      <h1>Agriculture</h1>
      <p>
        Agriculture is considered the backbone of Pakistan's economy, which
        relies heavily on its major crops. Pakistan's principal natural
        resources are arable land and water. Agriculture accounts for about
        18.9% of Pakistan's GDP and employs about 42.3% of the labour force. The
        most agricultural province is Punjab where wheat & cotton are the most
        grown. Mango orchards are mostly found in Sindh and Punjab provinces,
        making it the world's fourth largest producer of mangoes. All
        agricultural affairs and activities in Pakistan are overseen and
        regulated by the Ministry of Agriculture.
      </p>

      <h2>Production</h2>

      Pakistan production (2006):
      <br />

      largest global producer); In addition, smaller production of other
      agricultural products

      <h2>Rankings</h2>

      Pakistan is one of the world's largest producers and suppliers of food and
      crops (according to the various global sources).

      <br />*Chickpea (3rd) <br />*Apricot (6th) <br />*Cotton (5th) <br />*Milk

      <br />*Wheat (7th) <br />*Rice (11th) <br />Pakistan ranks 8th globally in
      farm output, according to the List of countries by GDP sector composition.

      <h2>Crops</h2>
      <p>
        The most important crops are wheat, sugarcane, cotton, and rice, which
        together account nearly more than 75% of the value of total crop output.
        Pakistan's largest food crop is wheat. As of 2018, According to the
        ministry of agriculture, Pakistan wheat output reached 26.3 million
        tonnes.In 2005, Pakistan produced 21,591,400 metric tons of wheat, more
        than all of Africa (20,304,585 metric tons) and nearly as much as all of
        South America (24,557,784 metric tons), according to the FAO. The
        country had harvested more than 25 to 23 million tons of wheat in 2012.
        Pakistan has also cut the use of dangerous pesticides dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pakistan is a net food exporter, except in occasional years, when its
        harvest is adversely affected by droughts. Pakistan exports rice,
        cotton, fish, fruits (especially Oranges and Mangoes), and vegetables
        and imports vegetable oil, wheat, pulses and consumer foods. The country
        is world largest raw cotton market, 2nd-largest apricot & ghee market &
        3rd-largest cotton, onion and milk market.
      </p>
      <h2>Fishery</h2>
      <p>
        Fishery and fishing industry plays an important role in the national
        economy. With a coastline of about 1046km, Pakistan has enough fishery
        resources that remain to be fully developed. It's also a major source of
        export earnings. Aquaculture is a rapidly developing industry. Punjab
        Province has demonstrated rapid growth in fish farming. GIFT Tilapia
        culture has been introduced recently in Pakistan (especially Punjab).
      </p>
      <h2>Forestry</h2>
      <p>
        About only 4% of land in Pakistan is covered with forest. The forests
        are a major source of food, lumber, paper, fuelwood, latex, medicine as
        well as utilised for purposes of wildlife conservation and ecotourism.
      </p>
      <h1>Industry</h1>
      <p>
        Pakistan's industrial sector (in FY21) accounts for 28.11% of the GDP.
        Of this, manufacturing makes up 12.52%, mining constitutes 2.18%,
        construction makes up 2.05%, and electricity and gas 1.36%. The majority
        of industry is made up of textile units, with textiles contributing
        $15.4b to exports, making up 56% of total exports. Other units include
        surgical instruments, chemicals, and a budding automotive industry.
        Pakistan's inadequately developed labor market, unable to absorb the
        increasing number of educated workers, has resulted in a high rate of
        unemployment among graduates.
      </p>
      <h2>Mining and quarrying</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan has immense reserves of various minerals and natural resources.
        Important minerals found in Pakistan are gypsum, limestone, chromites,
        iron ore, rock salt, silver, gold, precious stones, gems, marble,
        copper, coal, graphite, sulphur, fire clay, silica. The salt range in
        Punjab Province has one of the largest deposit of pure salt founded in
        the world. Balochistan province is a mineral-rich area having
        substantial mineral, oil and gas reserves which have not been exploited
        to their full capacity or fully explored, recent government policies
        have begun to develop this region of the country and to tap into the
        immense resources found there. The province has significant quantities
        of copper, chromite and iron, and pockets of antimony and zinc in the
        south and gold in the far west. Natural gas was discovered near Sui in
        1952, and the province has been gradually developing its oil and gas
        projects over the past fifty years.
      </p>
      <h2>Fuel extraction industry</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan's first oil field was discovered in the late 1952 in
        Balochistan near a giant gas field at Sui in Balochistan. The Toot
        oilfield was discovered in the early 1960s Islamabad in the Punjab.
        Production has steadily increased since then. All of the country's crude
        oil production gets refined at local oil refineries. There are five main
        oil refineries in Pakistan with a combined processing capacity of
        approximately 450,000 barrels per day (bpd). Cnergyico Pk Limited is the
        largest oil refiner with a total installed capacity of 156,000 barrels
        per day.Pakistan's first gas field was the giant gas field at Sui in
        Balochistan which was discovered in the late 1952. Pakistan is also a
        major producer of bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal and lignite. Coal
        mining started in the British colonial era and has continued to be used
        by Pakistani industries after independence in 1947.Pakistan produces
        about 40 to 45 tonnes uranium annually.
      </p>
      <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan's manufacturing sector is dominated by textiles, food,
        beverages, tobacco, coke and petroleum, and pharmaceuticals. The
        manufacturing sector is made up of three 'parts': Large Scale
        Manufacturing (LSM), Small Scale Manufacturing (SSM), and slaughtering.
        Large Scale Manufacturing at 9.73% of GDP dominates the overall
        manufacturing sector, accounting for 76.1% of the sectoral share
        followed by Small Scale Manufacturing, which accounts for 2.12% of total
        GDP and 16.6% sectoral share. The third component, slaughtering,
        accounts for 0.94% of GDP with 7.4% sectoral share. As a whole, the
        manufacturing sector is 12.79% of GDP, and employs 16.1% of the labor
        force.
      </p>
      <h2>Textiles</h2>
      <p>
        Textiles are the back of Pakistan's manufacturing base, contributing
        $15.4b to exports, making up 56% of total exports, and employing 40% of
        the labor force. Pakistan is the 8th largest exporter of textiles in
        Asia, and the 4th largest producer of cotton in the world. With
        increasing urbanization, and a growing middle-class, textiles have come
        under greater demand. The majority of the industry is located in Sindh
        and Punjab, especially north Punjab with the cities of Sialkot and
        Faisalabad being notable centers.
      </p>
      <h2>Automotive industry</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan's automotive industry is one of the fastest growing industries
        of the country, accounting for 4% of Pakistan's GDP and employing a
        workforce of over 1,800,000.00 people.Currently there are over 3200
        automotive manufacturing plants in the country, with an investment of
        Rs. 92 billion (US$320 million) producing 1.8 million motorcycles and
        200,000 vehicles annually. Its contribution to the national exchequer is
        nearly Rs. 50 billion (US$170 million). The sector, as a whole, provides
        employment to 3.5 million people and plays a pivotal role in promoting
        the growth of the vendor industry. Pakistan's auto market is considered
        among the smallest, but fastest growing in South Asia. Over 180,000 cars
        were sold in the fiscal year 2014–15, rising to 206,777 units fiscal
        year 2015–16. this is an old data, please verify before publish.
      </p>
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan has huge potential for the technology industry, which includes
        software development and electronics manufacturing. Pakistan
        Aeronautical Complex recently started the manufacturing of tablet PCs,
        e-book readers, and notebooks in collaboration with INNAVTEK of China.
        Software development also has a huge potential, which is being utilized
        as a result of numerous projects initiated by the Government of
        Pakistan.
      </p>

      <h2>Electricity, gas and water supply</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan has extensive energy resources, including fairly sizable
        natural gas reserves, some proven oil reserves, coal (Pakistan has the
        largest coal reserves in the world), and a large hydropower potential.
        However, the exploitation of energy resources has been slow due to a
        shortage of capital and domestic political constraints. Domestic
        petroleum production totals only about half the country's oil needs, and
        the need to import oil has contributed to Pakistan's trade deficits and
        past shortages of foreign exchange. The current government has announced
        that privatization in the oil and gas sector is a priority, as is the
        substitution of indigenous gas for imported oil, especially in the
        production of power. Pakistan is a world leader in the use of compressed
        natural gas (CNG) for personal automobiles.
