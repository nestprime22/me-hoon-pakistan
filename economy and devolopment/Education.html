      <p>
        <strong>Education system of Pakistan</strong> title can be described as
        the education system in Pakistan is a complex and evolving structure,
        influenced by historical, cultural, political, and socioeconomic
        factors. It includes both public and private institutions, with a wide
        disparity in quality and access. Education is governed at both federal
        and provincial levels, especially after the 18th Amendment which
        devolved much of the authority to the provinces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The education system in Pakistan is generally divided into six levels:
        preschool (from the age of 3 to 5), primary (years one to five), middle
        (years six to eight), secondary (years nine and ten, leading to the
        Secondary School Certificate or SSC), intermediate (years eleven and
        twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate or HSSC), and
        university programmes leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees. The
        Higher Education Commission established in 2002 is responsible for all
        universities and degree awarding institutes. It was established in 2002
        with Atta-ur-Rahman as its founding chairman.
      </p>

      <h1>Stages of formal education</h1>
      <h2>Primary education</h2>
      <p>
        Only about 67.5% of Pakistani children finish primary school
        education.[15] The standard national system of education is mainly
        inspired by the English educational system. Pre-school education is
        designed for the 3â€“5 years old and usually consists of three stages:
        Play Group, Nursery and Kindergarten (also called 'KG' or 'Prep'). After
        pre-school education, students go through junior school from years 1 to
        5. This is followed by middle school from years 6 to 8. In middle
        school, single-sex education is usually preferred by the Pakistani
        community, but co-education exists in cities. The curriculum is usually
        subject to the institution. The eight commonly studied disciplines are:
        <br />*Arts <br />* Computer Studies and ICT <br />* General Science
        (including Physics, Chemistry and Biology) <br />*Modern languages and
        literature i.e. Urdu and English <br />* Mathematics <br />* Religious
        Education i.e. Islamic Studies <br />*Social Studies (including Civics,
        Geography, History, Economics, Sociology and sometimes elements of law,
        politics and PHSE) <br />*Pakistan Studies (including Civics, Geography,
        History, Economics, Sociology and sometimes elements of law, politics
        and PHSE of Pakistan)
      </p>
      <p>
        Schools may also offer drama studies, music and physical education but
        these are usually not examined or marked. Home economics is sometimes
        taught to female students, whereas topics related to astronomy,
        environmental management and psychology are frequently included in
        textbooks of general science. Sometimes archaeology and anthropology are
        taught in textbooks of social studies. SRE is not taught at most schools
        in Pakistan, although this trend is being rebuked by some urban schools.
        Provincial and regional languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto and
        others may be taught in their respective provinces, particularly in
        regional language-medium schools. Some institutes give instruction in
        foreign languages such as German, Turkish, Arabic, Persian, French and
        Chinese. The language of instruction depends on the nature of the
        institution itself, whether it is an English-medium school or an
        Urdu-medium school.
      </p>

      <h2>Secondary education</h2>
      <p>
        Secondary education in Pakistan begins in year 9 and lasts for four
        years. After the end of each of the school years, students are required
        to pass a national examination administered by a regional Board of
        Intermediate and Secondary Education (or BISE).
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon completion of year 9, students are expected to take a standardised
        test in each of the first parts of their academic subjects (SSC-I). They
        take the tests of the second parts of the same courses at the end of
        year 10 (SSC-II). Upon successful completion of these examinations, they
        are awarded a Secondary School Certificate (or SSC). This is locally
        termed a matriculation certificate or matric for short. The curriculum
        usually includes a combination of eight courses including electives
        (such as Biology, Chemistry, Computer and Physics) as well as compulsory
        subjects (such as Mathematics, English, Urdu, Islamic studies and
        Pakistan Studies). The SSC exams consist of a total of 1100 marks
        divided between 9th and 10th. The marks are divided in each year
        follows: 75 marks for Maths, English and Urdu, 50 marks for Islamic
        Studies (or ethics for Non Muslim students) and Pakistan Studies, 65
        marks for Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics). An additional 90 marks
        are allotted for practicals (30 for each science). Students then enter
        an intermediate college and complete years 11 and 12. Upon completion of
        each of the two years, they again take standardised tests in their
        subjects (HSSC-I and HSSC-II). Upon successful completion of these
        examinations, students are awarded the Higher Secondary School
        Certificate (or HSSC). This level of education is also called the
        FSc/FA/ICS or intermediate. There are many streams students can choose
        for years 11 and 12, such as pre-medical, pre-engineering, humanities
        (or social sciences), computer science and commerce. Each stream
        consists of three electives and three compulsory subjects of English,
        Urdu, Islamiat (year 11 only) and Pakistan Studies (year 12 only).
      </p>
      <h2>Madrassas</h2>
      <p>
        Madrassas are Islamic seminaries. Most Madrasas teach mostly Islamic
        subjects such as Tafseer (Interpretation of the Quran), Hadith (sayings
        of Muhammad), Fiqh (Islamic Law), Arabic language and include some
        non-Islamic subjects, such as logic, philosophy, mathematics, to enable
        students to understand the religious ones. The number of madrassas are
        popular among Pakistan's poorest families in part because they feed and
        house their students. Estimates of the number of madrasas vary between
        12,000 and 40,000. In some areas of Pakistan they outnumber the public
        schools.
      </p>

      <h2>Qualitative dimension</h2>
      <p>
        In Pakistan, the quality of education has a declining trend. A shortage
        of teachers and poorly equipped laboratories have resulted in the
        out-dated curriculum that has little relevance to present-day needs. The
        education is based solely on cramming and the students lack professional
        as well as communicational skills, when they graduate from an
        institution. Moreover, the universities are expensive, due to which the
        Pakistani students cannot afford higher education. The universities do
        not provide skills that are in demand in the market. Pakistani students
        still rely on photocopied notes and summaries without any major update
        in textbooks.
      </p>
      <h2>Teacher education</h2>
      <p>
        Teacher education reform is crucial in improving education in Pakistan.
        Teacher training programs at universities lack qualified professionals.
        Almost one-third of universities in Balochistan do not have professors
        in their teacher education departments and there was not a PhD in
        Education at any of the universities in Balochistan. Teachers are the
        focal point of establishing progressive education. Teacher preparation
        programs need funding and consistency to produce quality, effective
        teachers. Teacher reform needs to continue by establishing resources and
        investments. Time needs to be invested in updating curriculum and
        teacher education facilities. Investments must be made in updating
        building infrastructures, libraries, IT departments, and
        laboratories.Teacher education has an impact on the general education of
        the country. Within Pakistan there are many common problems within
        schools, this includes not having proper training facilities, small
        termed training period, lack of in-service training for teachers, and
        other issues.
      </p>

      <h2>Teachers Issues</h2>
      <p>
        Teachers in Pakistan face a range of challenges and issues that impact
        their ability to provide quality education to students. Here are some
        common issues faced by teachers in Pakistan:

        <br />
        <strong> Low pay:</strong> Teachers in Pakistan are often paid low
        salaries, which can make it difficult to attract and retain talented
        individuals in the profession. <br /><strong
          >Inadequate resources:</strong
        >
        Teachers in Pakistan often have limited access to resources such as
        textbooks, classroom materials, and technology, which can make it
        difficult to provide effective instruction. <br /><strong
          >Overcrowded classrooms:</strong
        >
        Many classrooms in Pakistan are overcrowded, which can make it
        challenging for teachers to provide individual attention to each
        student. <br /><strong>Gender discrimination: </strong> Female teachers
        in Pakistan may face discrimination and harassment in the workplace, as
        well as cultural barriers that limit their access to education and
        professional development opportunities. <br /><strong
          >Lack of training:</strong
        >
        Many teachers in Pakistan have limited training and professional
        development opportunities, which can make it difficult for them to
        develop new teaching strategies and stay up-to-date with developments in
        their field. <br />
        <strong>Limited job security: </strong> Teachers in Pakistan may have
        limited job security, which can lead to high turnover rates and a lack
        of motivation among teachers. <br />
        <strong>Societal and cultural issues:</strong>Teachers in Pakistan may
        face societal and cultural barriers that limit their ability to teach
        certain subjects or work with certain student populations.
