      <p>
        <strong>China–Pakistan Economic Corridor</strong> title can be described
        as the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor( CPEC ) is a 3,000 km Chinese
        infrastructure network project currently under construction in Pakistan.
        This sea-and-land-based corridor aims to secure and shorten the route
        for China’s energy imports from the Middle East,avoiding the existing
        path through the Straits of Malacca between Malaysia and Indonesia,
        which could be blockaded in case of war, thereby threatening China’s
        energy-dependent economy.Developing a deep-water port at Gwadar in the
        Arabian Sea and establishing a robust road and rail network from this
        port to the Xinjiang region in western China would serve as a shortcut,
        enhancing trade between Europe and China. In Pakistan, the project aims
        to address electricity shortages, develop infrastructure, and modernize
        transportation networks, while also transitioning the economy from an
        agriculture-based structure to an industrial one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The potential industries being set up in the CPEC special economic zones
        include food processing, cooking oil, ceramics, gems and jewelry,
        marble, minerals, agriculture machinery, iron and steel, motorbike
        assembling, electrical appliances, and automobiles.
      </p>

      <h2>Announcement of CPEC</h2>
      <p>
        General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping described
        his "fate-changing visit" to Pakistan for signing the CPEC agreement by
        saying, "I feel as if I am going to visit the home of my brother,"[36]
        and claimed that the friendship between the two nations was "higher than
        mountains, deeper than oceans, and sweeter than honey." China frequently
        uses terms like "iron brothers" and "all-weather friends" to describe
        its relationship with Pakistan.On 20 April 2015, Pakistan and China
        signed an agreement to commence work on the $46 billion project, which
        is roughly 20% of Pakistan's annual GDP, with approximately $28 billion
        worth of fast-tracked "Early Harvest" projects to be developed by the
        end of 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of 2018, over 10,400 MW of generating capacity is expected to
        be brought online, with the majority developed as part of CPEC's
        fast-tracked "Early Harvest" projects. A network of pipelines for
        transporting liquefied natural gas and oil will also be laid, including
        a $2.5 billion pipeline between Gwadar and Nawabshah to eventually
        transport gas from Iran.Electricity from these projects will primarily
        be generated from fossil fuels, though hydroelectric and wind-power
        projects are also included, as well as the construction of one of the
        world's largest solar farms.CPEC is seen as a central component of
        China's Belt and Road Initiative.At the start of the project, Pakistan
        assigned about 10,000 troops to protect Chinese investments, a number
        that increased to 15,000 active troops by 2016.
      </p>

      <h2>Projects in Gwadar</h2>
      <p>
        Gwadar gained strategic importance after the Kargil War when Pakistan
        recognized the need for a military naval port, leading to the
        construction of the Karachi-Gwadar Coastal Highway for defense
        purposes.Gwadar is central to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor
        (CPEC) project, envisioned as the link between China's ambitious One
        Belt, One Road initiative and its 21st Century Maritime Silk Road
        project. Over $1 billion worth of projects were planned around the port
        by December 2017.Over the past two years, China has provided 7,000 solar
        panel sets to households in Gwadar. An additional 10,000 sets are being
        prepared for distribution to underprivileged communities in Balochistan.
        The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan is also set to donate household solar
        units and other forms of assistance to the people of Balochistan.
      </p>

      <h2>Gwadar city projects</h2>
      <p>
        China will grant Pakistan $230 million to construct a new international
        airport in Gwadar.The provincial government of Balochistan has set aside
        4,000 acres for the construction of the new $230 million Gwadar
        International Airport, which will require an estimated 30 months for
        completion. The costs will be fully funded by grants from the Chinese
        government, which Pakistan will not be obliged to repay.As of 2017,
        there are a total of nine projects funded by China in and around
        Gwadar.[95] Development of Gwadar includes the construction of a
        hospital funded by a Chinese government grant. The proposed project
        includes the building of medical blocks, nursing and paramedical
        institutes, a medical college, a central laboratory, and other allied
        facilities, along with the supply of medical equipment and machinery.
      </p>

      <h2>Roadway projects</h2>
      <p>
        The CPEC project includes significant upgrades and overhauls to
        Pakistan's transportation infrastructure. So far, China has announced
        financing for $10.63 billion worth of transportation infrastructure
        under the CPEC project; $6.1 billion has been allocated for constructing
        "Early Harvest" roadway projects at an interest rate of 1.6 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three corridors have been identified for cargo transport: the Eastern
        Alignment through the heavily populated provinces of Sindh and Punjab,
        where most industries are located; the Western Alignment through the
        less developed and more sparsely populated provinces of Khyber
        Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan; and the future Central Alignment, which
        will pass through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Balochistan.
      </p>

      <h2>Railway projects</h2>
      <p>
        The CPEC project emphasizes major upgrades to Pakistan's aging railway
        system, including the reconstruction of the entire Main Line 1 railway
        between Karachi and Peshawar by 2020. This railway currently handles 70%
        of Pakistan Railways traffic. As of 25 May 2022, the project is stalled
        due to China's reluctance to provide funds.In addition to the stalled
        Main Line 1 railway, upgrades and expansions are planned for Main Line 2
        and Main Line 3. The CPEC plan also includes completing a rail link over
        the 4,693-meter high Khunjerab Pass, providing direct access for Chinese
        and East Asian goods to Pakistani seaports at Karachi and Gwadar by
        2030.In September 2018, the new government led by Prime Minister Imran
        Khan reduced Chinese investment in the railways by $2 billion to $6.2
        billion due to financing burdens.
      </p>

      <h2>Khunjerab Railway</h2>
      <p>
        Longer-term projects under CPEC also call for the construction of the
        682-kilometer-long Khunjerab Railway line between the city of Havelian
        and the Khunjerab Pass on the Chinese border, with an extension to
        China's Lanxin Railway in Kashgar, Xinjiang. The railway will roughly
        parallel the Karakoram Highway and is expected to be completed by 2030.
        The cost of the entire project is estimated to be approximately $12
        billion and will require 5 years for completion. A 300 million rupee
        study to establish the final feasibility of constructing the rail line
        between Havelian and the Chinese border is already underway.A
        preliminary feasibility study was completed in 2008 by the Austrian
        engineering firm TBAC.
      </p>
      <h2>Lahore Metro</h2>
      <p>
        The Orange Line of the Lahore Metro is a significant commercial project
        under CPEC.[173] This $1.6 billion project was initially planned for
        completion by Winter 2017. However, it faced several delays and was
        finally launched on 25 October 2020. The Orange Line spans 27.1
        kilometers (16.8 mi), with 25.4 kilometers (15.8 mi) being elevated and
        the remaining portion underground between Jain Mandir and Lakshmi Chowk.
        The project has the capacity to transport 250,000 commuters per day,
        with plans to increase this to 500,000 commuters per day by 2025. As of
        now, the Orange Line of the Lahore Metro is fully operational. It is the
        first automated rapid transit line in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, and the
        first driverless metro in Pakistan. It is operated by the Punjab Mass
        Transit Authority and forms part of the Lahore Metro system.
      </p>
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        As of early 2024, CPEC is the most developed land corridor of the
        BRI.CPEC runs through twelve cities with over one million inhabitants
        and eighteen cities with populations over 100,000. On 8 January 2017,
        Forbes claimed that CPEC is part of China's vision to shape the rules of
        the next era of globalization and keep its export and investment engines
        running for years to come.According to China's premier, Li Keqiang,
        Pakistan's development through the project might "wean the populace from
        fundamentalism". In part because of the impact of CPEC, former EU
        diplomat Bruno Maçães describes the BRI as the world's first
        transnational industrial policy, as it extends beyond national policy to
        influence the industrial policy of other states.
      </p>
      <h2>Pakistani economy</h2>
      <p>
        The CPEC is considered a landmark project in the history of Pakistan,
        representing the largest investment the country has attracted since its
        independence and the largest by China in any foreign country.[263][264]
        CPEC is considered economically vital to Pakistan, helping to drive its
        economic growth.[265] The Pakistani media and government have called
        CPEC investments a "game and fate changer" for the region,[266][267]
        with both China and Pakistan aiming for the massive investment plan to
        transform Pakistan into a regional economic hub and further deepen the
        ties between the two countries.[268] Approximately one year after the
        announcement of CPEC, Zhang Baozhong, chairman of China Overseas Port
        Holding Company, told The Washington Post that his company planned to
        spend an additional $4.5 billion on roads, power, hotels, and other
        infrastructure for Gwadar's industrial zone,[89] representing one of the
        largest sums of foreign direct investment into Pakistan.
      </p>

      <h2>Challenges and Criticism</h2>
      <p>
        CPEC, despite its strategic and economic potential, faces several
        significant challenges and criticisms that affect its implementation and
        overall impact. One of the most pressing concerns is security,
        especially in the province of Balochistan, where separatist groups and
        insurgents have repeatedly targeted Chinese nationals, engineers, and
        CPEC-related infrastructure. These attacks are rooted in local
        grievances over resource control, political marginalization, and
        environmental concerns. In response, the Pakistan Army has created a
        special security division comprising thousands of personnel to ensure
        the safety of Chinese workers and protect key project sites, but
        security risks continue to pose a serious threat to smooth progress.
        Apart from security, financial and political issues also hinder the
        corridor's success. A major criticism is related to Pakistan's rising
        external debt, with many analysts warning that over-reliance on Chinese
        loans could create long-term economic dependency and repayment
        difficulties. There is also a lack of transparency in many of the CPEC
        agreements, leading to public and parliamentary concerns over hidden
        costs and terms unfavorable to Pakistan. Moreover, delays in project
        execution—due to bureaucratic inefficiencies, political instability, and
        lack of coordination—have slowed down progress. Additionally, there are
        growing complaints from smaller provinces like Balochistan and Khyber
        Pakhtunkhwa about the unequal distribution of benefits, with a
        perception that the Punjab province receives the lion’s share of
        infrastructure and industrial projects. These issues have sparked
        political debates and protests, raising questions about the
        inclusiveness and fairness of the CPEC framework.
