    Wasim Akram, one of the best fast bowlers in the history of cricket, revolutionized swing bowling. He was a crucial part of the 1992 World Cup-winning team and remains the highest wicket-taker for Pakistan in ODIs. Akram is also revered for mentoring young cricketers after retirement.

    Haider Ali made history by winning Pakistan’s first-ever Paralympic gold medal in the long jump at Tokyo 2020. He previously earned silver and bronze medals in the 2008 and 2016 Paralympics. His achievements have inspired athletes with disabilities and brought new focus to para-sports in Pakistan.
  </p>

  <h2>Inzamam-ul-Haq – The Gentle Giant</h2>
  <p>
    Inzamam is regarded as one of Pakistan’s greatest batsmen. With over 20,000 international runs, he was known for his calm presence at the crease and ability to anchor innings. He captained the national team and later served as chief selector, shaping the future of Pakistan cricket.
