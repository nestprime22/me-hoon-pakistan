  <p>
    Hockey has long been regarded as the national sport of Pakistan and was once a symbol of the country’s dominance on the international stage. During the golden era of Pakistani hockey, the national team achieved unparalleled success, making the green shirts a powerhouse of the sport across multiple decades.
  </p>

  <h2>Golden Era and Major Achievements</h2>
  <p>
    Pakistan's hockey team made its Olympic debut in 1948 and quickly rose to prominence. The country's first major breakthrough came with a gold medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics, breaking India's long-standing monopoly. This victory ignited a golden era for Pakistani hockey.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pakistan went on to win Olympic gold medals in 1968 (Mexico City) and 1984 (Los Angeles), along with several silver and bronze medals. On the World Cup stage, Pakistan has been unmatched with four world titles—1971 (Spain), 1978 (Argentina), 1982 (India), and 1994 (Australia)—a record still unbeaten.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pakistan has also won multiple Asian Games titles and Champions Trophy medals, asserting their dominance over the region for decades.
  </p>

  <h2>Legendary Players</h2>
  <p>
    Pakistani hockey has produced some of the greatest players the sport has ever seen:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shahbaz Ahmed:</strong> Often called the "Maradona of Hockey," known for his dribbling skills and game intelligence.</li>
    <li><strong>Hassan Sardar:</strong> A lethal forward who played a key role in Pakistan's 1984 Olympic gold and 1982 World Cup win.</li>
    <li><strong>Samiullah Khan:</strong> Known as the “Flying Horse” due to his speed and agility on the left wing.</li>
    <li><strong>Sohail Abbas:</strong> The highest goal scorer in international hockey history, renowned for his drag-flicks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Decline and Challenges</h2>
  <p>
    Despite the rich legacy, Pakistani hockey witnessed a sharp decline post-1990s due to mismanagement, lack of funding, poor infrastructure, and competition from cricket’s growing popularity. The team failed to qualify for the 2016 Rio and 2020 Tokyo Olympics—a significant low point in its history.
  </p>
  <p>
    Internal politics, outdated coaching methods, and lack of player development contributed to the steady fall in rankings. Once a global leader, Pakistan is now struggling to maintain its place in top-tier international tournaments.
  </p>

  <h2>Revival Efforts and the Road Ahead</h2>
  <p>
    In recent years, efforts have been made to revive hockey in Pakistan. International legends have been approached for coaching roles, new training camps have been established, and the government has pledged more financial support. Domestic leagues like the Pakistan Hockey Super League (PHSL) are also in planning stages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Young talents from areas like Gojra and Faisalabad continue to emerge, and there is optimism that with consistent support and modern reforms, Pakistan can reclaim its legacy in international hockey.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Pakistani hockey’s journey from global dominance to decline is a story of brilliance, neglect, and potential revival. While challenges remain, the passion for hockey still burns brightly among fans and young athletes across the nation. With strategic investment, modern coaching, and administrative reforms, Pakistan can once again rise in the international hockey arena.
