      <p><strong>Jahangir Khan</strong> 
        Jahangir Khan (Pashto, Urdu: جهانګير خان
        born 10 December 1963) is a former professional Pakistani squash player.
        He won the World Open title six times, and the British Open title ten
        times (1982–1991). He is widely regarded as the greatest squash player
        of all time,and the greatest sportsman in Pakistan history.From 1981 to
        1986, Khan was unbeaten and won 555 consecutive matches during that time
        – the longest winning streak by any athlete in top-level professional
        sport as recorded by Guinness World Records.<br />
        He retired as a player in 1993, and served as President of the World
        Squash Federation from 2002 to 2008. Later in 2008, he became Emeritus
        President of the World Squash Federation.
      </p>

      <h2>Early And Personal Life</h2>
      <p>
        Khan was born on 10 December 1963 in Karachi. His family originally
        hailed from Nawan Kalli, a small village near Peshawar in Pakistan.<br />
        A member of the Khan family, he was born into a family of squash
        players; his father Roshan Khan won the British Open title in 1957, and
        his older brother was Torsam Khan.<br />
        Two of his nieces are Natasha Khan (better known as Bat for Lashes), a
        British singer, and Maria Khan, a professional footballer who has played
        for the Pakistan women national football team.
      </p>

      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>
        Khan was coached initially by his father Roshan, the 1957 British Open
        champion, then by his brother Torsam.After his brother's sudden death he
        was coached by his cousin Rehmat, who guided Khan through most of his
        career.<br />
        In 1979, the Pakistan selectors decided not to select Khan to play in
        the world championships in Australia but he entered the World Amateur
        Individual Championship, at the age of 15, and became the youngest-ever
        winner of that event. In November 1979, Torsam Khan, who had been one of
        the leading international squash players in the 1970s, died suddenly of
        a heart attack during Australian Open match in Adelaide Australia.
        Torsam's death profoundly affected Khan. He considered quitting the
        game, but decided to pursue a career in the sport as a tribute to his
        brother.<br />
        He retired as a player in 1993,and has served as President of the World
        Squash Federation from 2002 to 2008, later became Emeritus President.
