        <strong>Malala yousafzai</strong> title can be described as the youngest
        Nobel Prize laureate in history, the second Pakistani and the only
        Pashtun to receive a Nobel Prize.[7] Yousafzai is a human rights
        advocate for the education of women and children in her native homeland,
        Swat, where the Pakistani Taliban had at times banned girls from
        attending school. Her advocacy has grown into an international movement,
        and according to former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, she has
        become Pakistan's "most prominent citizen.
      </p>

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Malala Yousafzai was born on 12 July 1997 in Mingora, Swat Valley,
        Pakistan. Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, is an educator and activist
        who founded the Khushal Girls High School and College. Growing up in a
        region that later came under Taliban influence, Malala was inspired by
        her father's activism and developed a passion for learning and
        advocating for girls' education.she was also inspired by her father's
        thoughts and humanitarian work.In early 2009, when she was 11, she wrote
        a blog under her pseudonym Gul Makai for the BBC Urdu to detail her life
        during the Taliban's occupation of Swat.
      </p>
      <h2>Activism Under Taliban Rule</h2>
      <p>
        In 2009, at the age of 11, Malala began writing a blog under the
        pseudonym "Gul Makai" for BBC Urdu, detailing her life under Taliban
        rule and her desire to continue her education. Her writings highlighted
        the challenges faced by girls in accessing education in Swat Valley.
        NobelPrize.org As her profile rose, Malala and her father became
        prominent advocates for girls' education in Pakistan, leading to
        increased recognition and, unfortunately, threats from the Taliban.
      </p>

      <h2>Assassination Attempt and Recovery</h2>
      <p>
        On 9 October 2012, while on a bus in Swat District after taking an exam,
        Yousafzai and two other girls were shot by a Taliban gunman in an
        assassination attempt targeting her for her activism; the gunman fled
        the scene. She was struck in the head by a bullet and remained
        unconscious and in critical condition at the Rawalpindi Institute of
        Cardiology, but her condition later improved enough for her to be
        transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK. After her
        recovery, Yousafzai became a more prominent activist for the right to
        education. Based in Birmingham, she co-founded the Malala Fund, a
        non-profit organisation, with Shiza Shahid. In 2013, she co-authored I
        Am Malala, an international best seller. In 2013, she received the
        Sakharov Prize, and in 2014, she was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel
        Peace Prize with Kailash Satyarthi of India. Aged 17 at the time, she
        was the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate. In 2015, she was the subject
        of the Oscar-shortlisted documentary He Named Me Malala. In 2017 she was
        awarded honorary Canadian citizenship and became the youngest person to
        address the House of Commons of Canada.
      </p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        From March 2013 to July 2017, Yousafzai was a pupil at the all-girls
        Edgbaston High School in Birmingham. In August 2015, she received 6 A*s
        and 4 As at GCSE level.At A-Level, she studied Geography, History,
        Mathematics and Religious Studies.Also applying to Durham University,
        the University of Warwick and the London School of Economics (LSE),
        Yousafzai was interviewed at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in December 2016
        and received a conditional offer of three As in her A‑Levels; in August
        2017, she was accepted to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics
        (PPE).In February 2020, climate change activist Greta Thunberg travelled
        to Oxford University to meet Yousafzai.On 19 June 2020, Yousafzai said
        after passing her final examinations that she had completed her PPE
        degree at Oxford;she graduated with honours.
      </p>
      <h2>Malala Day</h2>
      <p>
        On 12 July 2013, Yousafzai's 16th birthday, she spoke at the UN to call
        for worldwide access to education. The UN dubbed the event "Malala
        Day".Yousafzai wore one of Benazir Bhutto's shawls to the UN. It was her
        first public speech since the attack, leading the first ever Youth
        Takeover of the UN, with an audience of over 500 young education
        advocates from around the world. The terrorists thought they would
        change my aims and stop my ambitions, but nothing changed in my life
        except this: weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and
        courage was born ... I am not against anyone, neither am I here to speak
        in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist
        group. I'm here to speak up for the right of education for every child.
        I want education for the sons and daughters of the Taliban and all
        terrorists and extremists. Yousafzai received several standing ovations.
        Ban Ki-moon, who also spoke at the session, described her as "our hero".
        Yousafzai also presented the chamber with "The Education We Want", a
        Youth Resolution of education demands written by Youth for Youth, in a
        process co-ordinated by the UN Global Education First Youth Advocacy
        Group,telling her audience: Malala day is not my day. Today is the day
        of every woman, every boy and every girl who have raised their voice for
        their rights. The Pakistani government did not comment on Yousafzai's UN
        appearance, amid a backlash against her in Pakistan's press and social
        media.
      </p>

      <h2>Nobel Peace Prize</h2>
      <p>
        on 10 October 2014, at the age of 17, Malala was awarded the Nobel Peace
        Prize jointly with Indian children's rights activist Kailash Satyarthi.
        She became the youngest-ever Nobel laureate. The award recognized their
        struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for
        the right of all children to education. She is the second Pakistani to
        receive a Nobel Prize after 1979 Physics laureate Abdus Salam. After she
        was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, there was praise, but also some
        disapproval of the decision. A Norwegian jurist, Fredrik Heffermehl,
        commented on being awarded the Nobel Prize: "This is not for fine people
        who have done nice things and are glad to receive it. All of that is
        irrelevant. What Nobel wanted was a prize that promoted global
        disarmament.
      </p>

      <h2>Women's clothing, marriage</h2>
      <p>
        Yousafzai had said that she did not understand why people had to marry.
        After her own marriage in 2021 she said that she had not been against
        marriage, but had concerns about it related to child marriage and forced
        marriage, and unequal marriages where "women make more compromises than
        men". In her own marriage she felt that she had found a person who
        understood her values. On 7 March 2022, Malala Yousafzai advocated for
        every woman's right to decide to wear what she likes for herself, from a
        burqa to a bikini: "Come and talk to us about individual freedom and
        autonomy, about preventing harm and violence, about education and
        emancipation. Do not come with your wardrobe notes." According to
        Yousafzai, "refusing to let girls go to school in their hijabs is
        horrifying".
      </p>

      <h2>Personal life</h2>
      <p>
        On 9 November 2021, Yousafzai married Asser Malik, a manager with the
        Pakistan Cricket Board, in Birmingham.She is a supporter of Birmingham
        City.Yousafzai is a practising Sunni Muslim. In an interview with Muslim
        Girl, she stated, "[The Islamic] faith has always been a big part of my
        life – and it continues to be so today." She has also defended her
        practice of wearing a shayla.
      </p>

      <h2>Criticism</h2>
      <p>
        On 7 August 2019, following the Indian revocation of the special status
        of Jammu and Kashmir, Yousafzai urged the UN to help Kashmiri children
        go safely back to school in response to the Indian Government's lockdown
        and communications blackout in the Kashmir valley and expressed her
        concern about the situation, and appealed to the international community
        to ensure peace in Jammu and Kashmir.People in India accused her of
        spreading the "Pakistani agenda" over the Kashmir conflict, and being
        selective in condemning human rights abuses,while in Pakistan she was
        criticised for being late in her response. After the start of
        Gaza–Israel conflict in October 2023, Yousafzai drew criticism for being
        silent over Israel's onslaught on Gaza and her "hypocritical" support
        statement about the conflict. She was condemned by Pakistani authors
        Nida Kirmani and Mehr Tarar over a Broadway musical she co-produced with
        former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had rejected calls for
        ceasefire in Gaza. After a severe backlash, Yousafzai reaffirmed her
        support for people of Gaza and called for a ceasefire.
      </p>

      <h2>Works</h2>

      <p>
        Yousafzai's memoir I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for
        Education and Was Shot by the Taliban, co-written with British
        journalist Christina Lamb, was published in October 2013 by Little,
        Brown and Company in the US and by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK.[209]
        Fatima Bhutto, reviewing the book for The Guardian called the book
        "fearless" and stated that "the haters and conspiracy theorists would do
        well to read this book", though she criticised "the stiff, know-it-all
        voice of a foreign correspondent" that is interwoven with
        Yousafzai's.[210] Marie Arana for The Washington Post called the book
        "riveting" and wrote "It is difficult to imagine a chronicle of a war
        more moving, apart from perhaps the diary of Anne Frank."[211] Tina
        Jordan in Entertainment Weekly gave the book a "B+", writing "Malala's
        bravely eager voice can seem a little thin here, in I Am Malala, likely
        thanks to her co-writer, but her powerful message remains undiluted."
      </p>
      <p>
        A children's edition of the memoir was published in 2014 under the title
        I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the
        World.According to Publishers Weekly, in 2017 the book had sold almost 2
        million copies, and there were 750,000 copies of the children's edition
        in print. Yousafzai was the subject of the 2015 documentary He Named Me
        Malala, which was shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Documentary
        Feature. In 2020, an Indian Hindi-language biographical film Gul Makai
        by H. E. Amjad Khan was released, with Reem Sameer Shaikh portraying
        her. Yousafzai authored a picture book, Malala's Magic Pencil, which was
        illustrated by Kerascoët and published on 17 October 2017. By March
        2018, The Bookseller reported that the book had over 5,000 sales in the
        UK.In a review for The Guardian, Imogen Carter describes the book as
        "enchanting", opining that it "strikes just the right balance" between
        "heavy-handed" and "heartfelt", and is a "welcome addition to the
        frustratingly small range of children's books that feature BAME central
        characters". Rebecca Gurney of The Daily Californian gives the book a
        grade of 4.5 out of 5, calling it a "beautiful account of a terrifying
        but inspiring tale" and commenting "Though the story begins with
        fantasy, it ends starkly grounded in reality.

      <h2>Legacy of Malala Yousafzai</h2>
      <p>
        <br><strong>1. Global Symbol of Peaceful Resistance </strong>
        Malala became a global icon for peaceful resistance against oppression.
        Surviving a Taliban assassination attempt and responding not with hatred
        but with a renewed commitment to education and peace elevated her as a
        moral voice worldwide. Her message: “One child, one teacher, one book,
        and one pen can change the world” is quoted in global forums,
        classrooms, and parliaments alike. Her stance showed that nonviolence
        and education can be powerful weapons against extremism and ignorance.
        <br> <strong>2. Trailblazer for Girls’ Education </strong>
        Malala’s advocacy for 12 years of free, quality education for all girls
        globally changed the narrative in many countries where girls’ education
        is undervalued or denied. Through the Malala Fund, she has funded
        education projects in places like Pakistan, Nigeria, India, and Syria.
        She influenced global policy: her work has inspired legislation and
        funding commitments from governments and international organizations.
        <br> <strong> 3.Youngest Nobel Peace Prize</strong> Laureate In 2014, at age 17, she became the
        youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, breaking barriers of age,
        gender, and geography. This recognition wasn’t just symbolic—it
        validated youth voices in international policy and diplomacy. Her Nobel
        Prize speech reminded the world that young people are capable of global
        leadership.
        <br><strong> 4. Role Model for Youth and Women </strong> Malala serves as a role
        model to young people, especially girls, who aspire to lead, speak out,
        and create change. She embodies how courage and conviction can transcend
        violence and fear. Many girls now refer to themselves as "Malalas" in
        countries where seeking education remains risky.
      
      
     <strong> 5. Literary and Cultural Influence </strong>
Her memoir, "I Am Malala", has been translated into over 40 languages and included in school curricula around the world.

It has helped educators teach resilience, global citizenship, and human rights.

Documentaries and media about her life have also brought attention to issues affecting girls worldwide.
