      <strong><h1>Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi</h1></strong>
      <p>
        Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani politician,
        philanthropist, and former cricketer who served as the 19th prime
        minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. He was the
        founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and its
        chairman from 1996 to 2023.<br /><br />
        Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his
        international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan
        learned reverse swing bowling from Sarfraz Nawaz and passed on this
        technique to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who developed and popularised
        it in subsequent years. He was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the
        Year in 1983. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral
        umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its
        first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. He
        was awarded the International Cricketer of the Year award in 1989.
        Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for
        most of the 1980s and early 1990s. He initially decided to retire after
        the 1987 Cricket World Cup. However, at the request of President
        Zia-ul-Haq, he returned to lead the team in 1988 and ultimately guided
        Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory in 1992. In addition to
        achieving the All-Rounder's Triple, Khan holds the world record for the
        most wickets, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings
        as a captain in Test cricket. Moreover, he has won the most Player of
        the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall
        in Test history. Khan has often been compared to Franz Beckenbauer in
        terms of his popularity and influence in Pakistan. In 2009, he was
        inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.<br /><br />
        Founding Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996, Khan won a seat in the
        National Assembly from his hometown of Mianwali in the 2002 general
        election. PTI became the second-largest party by popular vote in the
        2013 election, and five years later, running on a populist platform, PTI
        formed a coalition government with independents, with Khan as prime
        minister. Khan's government inherited a balance of payments crisis and
        sought bailouts from the IMF. He presided over GDP growth after initial
        contraction, implemented austerity policies, and increased tax
        collection. His government committed to a renewable energy transition,
        launched the Ehsaas Programme, and the Plant for Pakistan initiative,
        and expanded the protected areas of Pakistan and Sehat Sahulat Program.
        The reforms and actions undertaken during his time in office were
        largely responsible for Pakistan's removal from the FATF greylist,
        though the official exit occurred shortly after his tenure. He presided
        over the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused economic turmoil and rising
        inflation in the country. In April 2022, during the constitutional
        crisis following the Lettergate affair, Khan became the first Pakistani
        prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence
        motion.<br /><br />
        In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission
        of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly
        of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an
        assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023,
        Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary
        forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests
        broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots.
        Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In
        August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being
        convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state
        possession.<br /><br />
        He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for
        leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act in the
        Lettergate affair, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic
        marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in
        mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023
        riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and
        in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year
        sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were
        filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

      <h2>Early Life And Family</h2>
      <p>
        Further Information: Family of Imran Khan Khan with his uncle Javed
        Zaman,who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957. Khan was born
        in Lahore on 5 October 1952.Though some sources state he was born on 25
        November 1952,Khan has said that this mistake stemmed from that date
        being written erroneously on his passport.He is the only son of
        Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum,
        and has four sisters.<br /><br />
        Khan is of Pathan origin belonging to the Niazi tribe from his paternal
        family,and claims that one of his ancestors was Haibat Khan Niazi, a
        leading general of Sher Shah Suri in the 16th century and the governor
        of Punjab.Khan's maternal family belongs to the Burki community,and has
        produced a number of cricketers, including those who have represented
        Pakistan,such as his cousins Javed Burki and Majid Khan.According to
        Khaled Ahmed, Khan is also a descendant of the Sufi mystic and founder
        of the Roshaniya Movement, Pir Roshan, who hailed from his maternal
        family's ancestral town of Kaniguram in South Waziristan, Khyber
        Pakhtunkhwa.Khan's maternal family lived near Jalandhar, for centuries
        before migrating to Pakistan after the Independence in 1947.<br /><br />
        He studied at Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore. In 2021,
        Khan revealed that he had played for the Colts Hockey team in the
        mid-1960s.Khan arrived at the Royal Grammar School Worcester in England
        in September 1971, where he excelled at cricket. During the
        Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Khan took a part-time job at a store in
        England to support himself while studying. He worked during the
        Christmas season, washing dishes and cutting cheese. "It was my first
        and only job," he said, adding that it ended after ten days due to an
        argument with someone there.<br /><br />
        In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,Khan was
        admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics
        and economics, graduating in 1975.Paul Hayes, a keen cricket enthusiast,
        played a role in facilitating his entry.<br /><br />
        During the 1980s, Khan was inspired by the writings of the
        poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal, the Iranian writer-sociologist Ali
        Shariati, and the British diplomat-convert Charles Le Gai Eaton. He
        found their works intellectually stimulating and influential in
        deepening his understanding of Islam, particularly its potential for
        creating a just society and its compatibility with Western identily.
      </p>
      <h2>Personal Life</h2>
      <p>
        Khan had numerous relationships during his bachelor life.He was then
        known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's
        nightlife, frequently visiting venues such as Tramp in St James's.One or
        two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British
        tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the
        most eligible bachelors.<br /><br />
        His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and the daughter of
        British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The
        Times states that Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his
        first marriage".They first met in 1982 and subsequently visited
        Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to
        Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.She painted a portrait of Khan
        during their relationship at his request.Khan's residence in Chelsea,
        near Sergeant's studio and Tramp nightclub, became a central location
        for his social activities. After long separations, his relationship with
        Sergeant ended in 1986.<br /><br />
        Some of the other women with whom he was associated during this period
        include Zeenat Aman,Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,Stephanie Beacham,
        Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles, Anastasia
        Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not result in
        permanence, as Khan made it clear that residing in Pakistan was a
        requirement for a serious, long-term commitment.<br /><br />
        Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White, who
        later adopted the name Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986,
        shortly after his relationship with Emma Sergeant ended. The
        relationship lasted for two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote
        White a note stating that he could not love her as Emma would always be
        the love of his life. Despite the breakup, White became pregnant after a
        final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,in
        June 1992. White later claimed Khan was the father and continued to keep
        a framed photograph of him after their split. Tyrian became the subject
        of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan to be her
        father after White filed a paternity suit. The court issued the ruling
        after Khan failed to respond to the suit and a request for a blood
        test.Khan denied paternity and called for a paternity test in Pakistan,
        stating that he would accept the decision of the courts of
        Pakistan.After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife at the time
        and a friend of Sita, was designated by Sita as the legal guardian of
        Tyrian in her will. Khan stated that Tyrian would be welcome to join
        their family in London, leaving the decision entirely up to her, given
        her established relationship with his and Jemima's sons.<br /><br />
        In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German-born MTV
        host. Their relationship lasted for nearly two years, during which he
        introduced her to Islam. After their relationship ended, she converted
        to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.<br /><br />
        Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The
        couple announced that they were to marry, with Khan stating that Jemima
        had converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the
        religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her
        father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[40] On 16 May 1995, the
        couple got married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris.
        Later, on 21 June, they had another wedding in a civil ceremony at the
        Richmond register office before embarking on their new life in Lahore.
        The couple had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[41] On 22 June 2004, it
        was announced that the couple had divorced, ending their nine-year
        marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in
        Pakistan."<br /><br />
        In a 2009 book, Christopher Sandford claimed that Khan and Benazir
        Bhutto had a close relationship when they were both students at Oxford.
        He wrote that Bhutto, at the age of 21, became close to Khan in 1975.
        They remained in a relationship for about two months. Sandford further
        claimed that Khan's mother had attempted to arrange a marriage between
        them, though this was unsuccessful. He also suggested that their
        relationship was possibly sexual, but Khan strongly denied these claims,
        stating that they were only friends.<br /><br />
        On 8 January 2015, it was announced that Khan had married
        British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at
        his residence in Islamabad.[44] On 22 October 2015, they announced their
        intention to file for divorce.<br /><br />
        In 2016, media speculations emerged regarding Khan's possible third
        marriage, particularly in connection with his spiritual association with
        the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports suggested that Khan had visited
        Pakpattan multiple times in July 2016, allegedly to meet Maryam Riaz
        Wattoo, the sister of his spiritual guide, Bushra Bibi. However, these
        reports were later refuted by Khan and his party. Khan publicly denied
        the rumours on Twitter, clarifying that the reports about his third
        marriage were "absolutely baseless" and saying that when he does decide
        to marry, he would make an official announcement and celebrate
        publicly.Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour. Khan
        termed the media "unethical" for spreading the rumour,and PTI filed a
        complaint against the news channels that had aired it.On 7 January 2018,
        the PTI central secretariat issued a statement confirming that Khan had
        proposed to Bushra, but she had yet to accept his proposal.On 18
        February 2018, PTI confirmed that Khan had married Bushra.<br /><br />
        According to Khan, his life has been influenced by Sufism for three
        decades, which is what drew him closer to his wife.The Mufti who
        conducted the marriage later testified in court that Khan's nikah had
        been conducted twice. The first nikah was performed on 1 January 2018,
        while his to-be wife was reportedly still in her Iddat. The Mufti
        alleged Khan believed he would become prime minister if he married her
        on that date.<br /><br />
        As of 2018, Khan owned five pet dogs, with one named Motu residing at
        his estate in Bani Gala.

      <h2>Cricket Career</h2>
      <p>
        Khan made his first-class debut at the age of 16 in Lahore. By the early
        1970s, he was playing for his hometown teams, including Lahore A, Lahore
        B,Lahore Greens, and eventually Lahore. He was also a part of the
        University of Oxford's Blues Cricket team during the 1973–1975
        seasons.Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for
        Worcestershire. During this period, he also represented Dawood
        Industries and Pakistan International Airlines.From 1983 to 1988, he
        played for Sussex.<br /><br />
        Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at
        Edgbaston.Three years later, in August 1974, he played his first One Day
        International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for
        the Prudential Trophy.By 1977, Khan was included in the roster of Kerry
        Packer's World Series Cricket.<br /><br />
        Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991. As a bowler,
        Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz, who is regarded as the
        founder of that technique. Khan later passed on this skill to Wasim
        Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.From January
        1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18
        five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls. His bowling average and
        strike rate were better than those of Richard Hadlee (19.03), Malcolm
        Marshall (20.20), Dennis Lillee (24.07), Joel Garner (20.62), and
        Michael Holding (23.68).Khan was the highest wicket-taker in Test
        matches in the calendar year 1982.He recorded the best Test bowling
        figures of his career by taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka
        in 1981–82.
      </p>

      <h3>*Captaincy</h3>
      <p>
        In 1982, Khan took over the captaincy of the Pakistan national cricket
        team.Under Khan's captaincy, Pakistan achieved their first Test win on
        English soil after 28 years at Lord's in 1982.In 1983, he was named one
        of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.During Pakistan's 1982–83 home
        series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.In
        January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score
        a century and take 10 wickets in a Test match during the series. The
        following month, during the same series, he attained a Test bowling
        rating of 922 points, placing him third in the ICC's all-time Test
        bowling rankings. Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200
        Test wickets, while the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said that he "bowled
        with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder
        Amarnath faced him with any confidence." However, the series also led to
        a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him for over two years.
        Initially, he could still bat but could not bowl, but after further
        complications, he was completely unable to participate in cricket. An
        experimental treatment, funded by the Pakistani government and
        administered in London, helped him recover by the end of 1984. Khan
        returned to the national team under the captaincy of Javed Miandad in a
        home series against Sri Lanka in 1984–85. Miandad chose not to continue
        as captain, attributing his decision to the internal tension created by
        Khan's non-cooperation with the team's strategy, which resulted in Khan
        being restored as the captain.<br /><br />
        In 1987, in India, Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series win,
        which was followed by Pakistan's first series victory in England during
        the same year.Khan retired from international cricket at the end of the
        1987 Cricket World Cup.He was asked to return to the captaincy by the
        President of Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq and decided to rejoin the
        team.Soon after returning to the captaincy, Khan led Pakistan on another
        successful tour of the West Indies, which he recounted as "the last time
        I really bowled well."He was declared the Man of the Series against the
        West Indies in 1988 after taking 23 wickets in three Tests.<br /><br />
        As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Test matches, winning 14, losing 8,
        and drawing the remaining 26. He also captained in 139 ODIs, securing 75
        victories, suffering 59 defeats, and ending one in a tie.In Test
        cricket, he holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain,
        the second-best bowling figures in an innings (8 wickets for 60 runs),
        the most five-wicket hauls in an innings, and the most ten-wicket hauls
        in a match.Khan has been compared to Franz Beckenbauer in terms of his
        popularity and influence in Pakistan.
      </p>
      <h3>*1992 Cricket World Cup Final</h3>
      <p>
        Khan's career high as a cricketer and captain came when he led Pakistan
        to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. During the tournament,
        especially in the final, he promoted himself in the batting order. Khan
        was the top scorer in the final, scoring 72 runs.By the 35th over, Khan
        brought back Wasim Akram, who delivered the two most decisive blows to
        England.Khan took the winning final wicket himself. This was Pakistan's
        first world cup victory.After the victory, Khan proclaimed, It was
        rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to
        play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about
        bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.
      </p>
      <h3>*Retirement</h3>
      <p>
        He played his last Test match for Pakistan in January 1992, against Sri
        Lanka. Khan retired from international cricket after leading Pakistan to
        victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.
      </p>
      <h3>*Career Stats</h3>
      <p>
        He ended his career with 88 Test matches, 126 innings, and scored 3,807
        runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries and 18 fifties. His
        highest score was 136.Khan had the second-highest all-time batting
        average of 61.86 for a Test batsman playing at number six in the batting
        order.As a bowler, he took 362 wickets in Test cricket. He has won the
        most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan, and ranks
        fourth overall in Test history.In ODIs, he played 175 matches and scored
        3,709 runs at an average of 33.41. His highest score was 102 not out.His
        best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, a record for the best bowling figures by
        any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.Khan achieved the
        all-rounder's triple (securing 3,000 runs and 300 wickets) in 75 Tests,
        becoming one of the first four players to reach this milestone. As of
        2025, he is one of eleven players to have achieved this feat,and his
        75-Test achievement remains the third-fastest in history.
      </p>
      <h2>Post-Retirement From Cricket</h2>
      <p>
        On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed as the Chancellor of the
        University of Bradford.In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket
        Hall of Fame.On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union
        floated a no-confidence motion to remove Khan from the post due to his
        absence from every graduation ceremony since 2010. On 30 November 2014,
        Khan stepped down, citing his "increasing political commitments".
        However, Khan was essentially compelled to resign due to mounting
        pressure from the union. Bradford University's Vice-Chancellor, Brian
        Cantor, appealed to students to show sympathy.He said Khan had been "a
        wonderful role model for our students."

      <br />
      *Main Articles: "Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre and
      Namal College"<br />
      <p>
        Khan served as UNICEF's Special Representative for Sports and promoted
        health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
        and Thailand.By 1994, Khan had established Pakistan's first cancer
        hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research
        Centre, named after his mother, Shaukat Khanum, using donations and
        funds exceeding $25 million. The money was raised by Khan through
        touring the country and appealing for contributions, with the majority
        of donations coming from the poor.<br /><br />
        Khan fundraising for Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and
        Research Centre in Jeddah, 1992 As a result of the 2001 Islamabad cloud
        burst, Pakistan faced severe flooding. In response, Khan auctioned his
        signed cricket bat from the 1992 Cricket World Cup and the sweater he
        wore while playing cricket. The bat alone raised $20,000 for flood
        victims. Khan stated that these were the last two items he had left, as
        he had previously auctioned off the rest to support Shaukat Khanum
        Hospital.<br /><br />
        In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford,
        signed a memorandum of understanding with the University of Bradford,
        establishing Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. The
        college was planned to be built by the Mianwali Development Trust on
        land donated by locals and aimed to tackle unemployment by providing
        technical and vocational education.In July 2006, Khan announced his
        vision behind Namal College, saying,"I want to make young people
        employable by arming them with the skills they will need to get jobs."
        Namal College officially opened in 2008.<br /><br />
        According to a 2006 report, while visiting his children in London, he
        also worked with the Lord's Taverners, a cricket charity.<br /><br />
        Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006. In
        January 2013, IKF announced a Rs30 million emergency relief project for
        internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees of the war on terror,
        belonging to the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan who were neglected by
        the government. The project provided food supplies, winter essentials,
        and waterproof tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

      <h2>Political Career</h2>
      <br />

      <h3>*Initial Years</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Khan was offered political positions several times during his cricketing
        career. In 1987, then-President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a position in the
        Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he politely declined. Nawaz Sharif
        invited Khan to join his political party, offering him the position of
        second-in-command and guaranteeing 30 seats in the national parliament.
        However, Khan declined the offer.[112] In 1993, Khan was appointed as
        the ambassador for tourism in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin
        Ahmad Qureshi and held the portfolio for three months until the
        government was dissolved. In late 1994, Khan joined hands with former
        Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali
        Durrani, who was heading Pasban, a breakaway wing of Jamaat-e-Islami.
        The three planned to launch a "pressure group," which was intended to
        act as a civil society watchdog rather than a full-fledged political
        party. However, Khan soon became uncomfortable with the idea of being
        seen as a puppet of Gul, which led to his departure from the group.<br /><br />
        In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a potential military
        coup that could appoint Khan as Prime Minister, responded with marked
        hostility towards him. The state-run television refused to broadcast
        archival footage of Imran's cricketing heyday and banned fundraising
        advertisements for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during
        Ramadan, a month when Muslims traditionally give to charity. Authorities
        also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds
        and was being investigated for tax irregularities. As a result,
        donations to the hospital, which relied entirely on charitable
        contributions, were halved that year.<br /><br />
        On 25 April 1996, Khan founded a political party, Pakistan
        Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).He ran for a seat in the National Assembly of
        Pakistan in the 1997 Pakistani general election as a candidate of PTI
        from two constituencies – NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore – but was
        unsuccessful and lost both seats to candidates of PML-N.<br /><br />
        Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état, believing
        that Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political
        mafias."Khan's PTI was one of the parties that supported Pervez
        Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.According to Khan, he was
        Musharraf's choice for Prime Minister in 2002, but he turned down the
        offer. Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said
        that if his party did not get a majority of the vote, they would
        consider forming a coalition. He was the only member of his party to win
        a seat in that election.<br /><br />
        In August 2005, Declan Walsh described Khan as a "miserable politician",
        observing that "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in
        1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He
        preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the
        next."<br /><br />
        In March 2006, Khan was escorted by police to his home and placed under
        house arrest after he threatened to organise a protest against President
        George W. Bush, who was on a visit to Pakistan.<br /><br />
        On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan
        joined 85 other MPs to resign from Parliament in protest of the
        presidential election scheduled for 6 October, which general Musharraf
        was contesting without resigning as army chief.On 3 November 2007, Khan
        was put under house arrest after president Musharraf declared a state of
        emergency in Pakistan. He later escaped from detention.He eventually
        came out of hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the
        University of the Punjab. At the rally, Khan was dragged into a physics
        building by activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing
        of Jamaat-e-Islami, and was held in a headlock. He was arrested during
        the protest and was sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he
        spent a week before being released.<br /><br />
      </p>
      On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed more than 100,000 supporters in Lahore,
      challenging the policies of the government, and referred to his movement
      as "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami." Another public gathering
      of at least 100,000 supporters was held in Karachi on 25 December
      2011.According to a survey conducted by the International Republican
      Institute (IRI) in 2012, Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) topped the
      list of popular political parties in Pakistan at the national level,
      securing 31% of the vote. The survey, conducted between 9 February and 8
      March 2012, placed PTI ahead of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N),
      which received 27%, and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which garnered
      16%. The survey also highlighted PTI's strong performance, particularly in
      Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (49%) and Balochistan (35%), where the party secured
      the top position, though it stood second in Punjab with 33%.<br /><br />
      On 6 October 2012, Khan joined a vehicle caravan of protesters from
      Islamabad to the village of Kotai in South Waziristan region to protest
      against US drone missile strikes.<br /><br />
      <h3>*2013 Elections</h3>
      <p>
        On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, where
        he addressed thousands of supporters at The Mall.Khan announced that he
        would pull Pakistan out of the US-led war on terror and bring peace to
        the Pashtun tribal belt.He addressed various public meetings in
        different cities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other parts of the country,
        where he announced that PTI would introduce a uniform education system
        in which the children of both the rich and the poor would have equal
        opportunities. Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki
        belt by addressing rallies in various cities.<br /><br />
        The last survey before the elections by The Herald showed that 24.98
        percent of voters nationally planned to vote for his party, slightly
        behind Nawaz Sharif's PML-N, which secured 25.1 percent of the vote.On 7
        May, just four days before the elections, Khan was shifted to Shaukat
        Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre in Lahore after
        falling from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally. He sustained
        head injuries,and fractured four vertebrae.Khan ended the campaign by
        addressing a rally of supporters in Islamabad via a video link while
        lying on a bed at a hospital in Lahore.<br /><br />
        The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May across the
        country. Nawaz Sharif and his party, the Pakistan Muslim League (N),
        secured victory in the elections, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.Khan's
        party emerged as the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber
        Pakhtunkhwa.Khan's party became the second-largest in terms of popular
        vote nationwide, securing 28 directly elected parliamentary seats,
        making it the third-largest party in the National Assembly of Pakistan
        behind the PML-N and the PPP.The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a
        leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML
        (N).While Khan's party welcomed the vote, Khan pledged to release a
        white paper on the alleged vote-rigging and vowed to hold protests. He
        praised the record voter turnout, particularly the participation of
        youth and women, describing it as a "step forward for democracy."<br /><br />
        While recovering in hospital, Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to form and
        lead his party's first provincial government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
      </p>
      <h3>*In Opposition</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Khan assumed the role of parliamentary leader of his party in the
        National Assembly of Pakistan following the 2013 elections.On 31 July
        2013, Khan received a contempt of court notice for allegedly criticising
        the superior judiciary and referring to it as "shameful."The notice was
        discharged after Khan submitted before the Supreme Court of Pakistan
        that he had criticised the lower judiciary for their actions during the
        May 2013 general elections, while those judicial officers were working
        as returning officers.Khan was criticised for his support of
        Sami-ul-Haq, known as the "Father of the Taliban," and for providing
        funds to his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.<br /><br />
        A year after the elections, on 11 May 2014, at a rally of his
        supporters, Khan called for the resignation of all members of the
        Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the formation of a new ECP, and
        strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses." On 14
        August 2014, Khan led a rally of supporters from Lahore to Islamabad,
        demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and an
        investigation into the alleged electoral fraud.Khan and
        Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri entered into a "de
        facto" alliance, both aiming to mobilise their supporters for a regime
        change campaign against Sharif.<br /><br />
        "The 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan called off his 126-day sit-in
        in the interest of national unity on 17 December."<br /><br />
        In March 2015, Khan's party reached an agreement with the Sharif
        administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud
        allegations — a move facilitated by the then Army Chief, General Raheel
        Sharif.In July, the commission determined that the elections had been
        broadly fair and found no systemic rigging.Khan accepted the
        commission's findings but expressed reservations over not having
        received a copy. "We have not seen the report yet, if we had, I would
        have been in a better position to comment on the report. We will comment
        on the report tomorrow after reading it," Khan said while addressing a
        press conference.<br /><br />
        Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif in the wake of the Panama Papers
        leaks in 2016, which revealed offshore companies linked to the Sharif
        family. He led protests, filed petitions through his party, and called
        for Sharif's resignation, citing allegations of corruption.[166] Khan's
        party petitioned the Supreme Court regarding the Panama Papers case to
        investigate allegations of corruption involving Sharif's family. Khan
        described the case as a "defining moment" for the country.<br /><br />
        On 7 April 2017, Khan criticised Pakistan's decision to support the
        Afghan jihad in the 1980s. Khan stated, "We made a big mistake in the
        80s by entering into the jihad against the soviets. That left Pakistan
        with militants, militant groups, we had Kalashnikovs flooded and we had
        drugs which could be used to finance the war." Khan further added that
        prior to joining the war, Pakistan never had sectarian militant groups,
        "Fast forward to another decade later 9/11 happens and we are hunting
        the same jihadi groups which became terrorists." Khan remarked that
        Pakistan took dollars to prepare militants and then later took dollars
        to fight against them. Khan also expressed his views regarding US
        President Donald Trump, saying, "When Trump got elected and then I saw
        his team...I thought to myself he is not as bad as I thought he was, he
        is much worse."
      </p>
      <h2>2018 Elections Campaign</h2>
      <p>
        On 20 May 2018, Khan's party announced a 100-day agenda ahead of the
        2018 general elections. The plan proposed sweeping reforms in nearly all
        areas of governance. Key elements included the creation of a new
        province in Southern Punjab, fast-tracking the merger of the Federally
        Administered Tribal Areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, improvements to the
        law and order situation in Karachi, and efforts to improve relations
        with political leaders in Balochistan.<br /><br />
        During his victory speech, Khan laid out the policy outlines for his
        future government. He said that his inspiration was to build Pakistan as
        a humanitarian state based on the principles of the first Islamic state
        of Medina. He said that his future government would prioritise the poor
        and common people of the country, and all policies would be directed
        towards raising the standard of living of the less fortunate. He
        promised an investigation into the allegations of rigging. He expressed
        his desire for a united Pakistan and pledged not to victimise his
        political opponents. He said that everyone would be equal before the
        law. He also promised a simple and less extravagant government, in which
        the Prime Minister of Pakistan House would be converted into an
        educational institute and the Governor Houses would be used for public
        benefit. On foreign policy, he praised China and expressed hope for
        better relations with Afghanistan, the United States, and India.
        Regarding the Middle East, he said that his government would strive to
        maintain a balanced relationship with Saudi Arabia and Iran.
      </p>
      <h3>*Nominations And Appointments</h3>
      <p>
        On 6 August 2018, his party formally nominated him as its candidate for
        the office of prime minister.In his speech, Khan vowed to reserve an
        hour each week to interact with the public and answer questions they
        send his way, calling it "one hour of accountability." He designated
        Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.He nominated
        Mahmood Khan as Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sardar Usman
        Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab. Announcing the nomination, Khan
        said that he chose Buzdar because he hails from the most underdeveloped
        area of Punjab.According to sources within PTI, Buzdar was nominated as
        a stop-gap arrangement because it would be easier to remove a
        lesser-known individual when Shah Mahmood Qureshi was ready to become
        chief minister. Some within PTI suggested that he was chosen because
        other potential candidates like the Dareshaks, Khosas, and Hashim Jawan
        Bakht declined the offer to take on a temporary role.In Balochistan,
        Khan directed his party to support the Balochistan Awami Party, which
        nominated Jam Kamal Khan for the position of chief minister and Abdul
        Quddus Bizenjo for speaker.<br /><br />
        Khan's party nominated Asad Qaiser as the Speaker of the National
        Assembly of Pakistan,and PML-Q leader Pervaiz Elahi for the position of
        Speaker of the Punjab Assembly.In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Mushtaq Ahmed
        Ghani was nominated as Speaker of its Assembly.

      <h2>Prime Minister (2018–2022)</h2>
      <p>
        *Main Article: Premiership Of Imran Khan*<br />
        Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August
        2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018
        Pakistani general election.His inauguration speech emphasised governance
        based on the principles of the Islamic state of Medina.Early
        bureaucratic reshuffles saw the appointment of Sohail Mahmood as Foreign
        Secretary, Rizwan Ahmed as Maritime Secretary, and Naveed Kamran Baloch
        as Finance Secretary. His first major military appointment was Lt.
        General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services
        Intelligence.Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio
        after forming his cabinet.

      <h3>*Economy</h3>
      <p>
        Khan's government faced significant economic challenges after taking
        office in 2018, inheriting a twin balance of payments and debt crisis.
        His administration sought to stabilize the economy through a mix of
        austerity measures, structural reforms, and a $6 billion bailout from
        the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These measures, which included
        devaluing the rupee, slashing subsidies, and targeting ambitious tax
        revenue goals, led to criticism from those who believed they
        contradicted Khan's promises of establishing an Islamic welfare state.
        Among the unpopular reforms were increased gas and electricity tariffs,
        straining citizens' daily lives.Despite these challenges, Khan's
        policies achieved some economic progress. In its 2020 report, the World
        Bank's Ease of doing business index noted that Pakistan's business
        environment improved significantly, moving from 136th to 108th in global
        rankings, driven by six key regulatory reforms.
      </p>
      <h3>*Environment And Energy</h3>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a
        fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand
        Dam.In September 2018, Khan endorsed Nisar's initiative and urged
        overseas Pakistanis to contribute through voluntary donations.As of
        November 2023, the dams fund stood at Rs17.86 billion.<br /><br />
        His government reported record hydropower generation by WAPDA in
        2019–2020, marking a 20% increase from the previous year. Key hydropower
        projects, including Dasu Dam, Mohmand Dam, and Diamer-Bhasha Dam, were
        initiated, alongside the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124
        MW) signed in June 2020.His government pledged to avoid new coal-fired
        power stations, aiming instead for a renewable energy target of 60% by
        2030. The cancellation of two planned coal projects was part of this
        shift.Efforts towards climate change mitigation included the launch of
        the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami Programme, aiming to plant 10 billion trees
        across Pakistan. The government reported that approximately 1.5 million
        trees were planted on the programme's first day.A special audit revealed
        over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities, including fake reporting and
        unverified plantation claims.
      </p>
      <h3>*Foreign Policy</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        In November 2018, after President Donald Trump accused Pakistan of
        failing to aid the U.S. in the War on Terror, Khan responded by
        highlighting Pakistan's losses and contributions, stating that the
        country was "not your hired gun anymore."<br /><br />
        The 2019 Pulwama attack, India accused Pakistan of involvement,
        prompting Khan to authorize a military response if attacked.This
        culminated in the 2019 Balakot airstrike by India, which Pakistan
        countered with Operation Swift Retort, leading to the capture of Indian
        pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, whom Khan later released as a peace
        gesture.Khan refused to engage with India after the Revocation of the
        special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019 and twice denied
        Narendra Modi the use of Pakistani airspace.<br /><br />
        In September 2019, Khan stated that Trump had asked him to facilitate
        U.S.-Iran talks and that Khan had spoken to Iranian President Hassan
        Rouhani. Trump later stated that Khan expressed a desire to mediate and
        they had a good relationship. Trump said a meeting between himself and
        Rouhani had not been agreed upon.He later visited both Iran and Saudi
        Arabia to ease tensions between the two nations. Saudi Arabia said it
        had not requested mediation.<br /><br />
        His government also improved relations with Gulf states, including the
        United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, with Pakistan securing debt
        relief and diplomatic engagement. His visit to Saudi Arabia was seen as
        an effort to restore relations strained by Pakistan's refusal to support
        the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war.<br /><br />
        In February 2022,Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two
        decades to visit Moscow, seeking to strengthen economic ties and address
        Pakistan's energy needs. His visit coincided with the onset of the
        Russian invasion of Ukraine, prompting international criticism,
        including from the United States, which urged responsible nations to
        oppose Vladimir Putin's actions.Discussions with Putin focused on
        "economic and energy cooperation," including the development of the
        Pakistan Stream gas pipeline.<br /><br />
        Khan said that the visit to Russia was pre-planned and aimed at
        fostering neutrality in global alliances.During a subsequent UN General
        Assembly emergency session, Pakistan abstained from condemning Russia,
        with Khan advocating for de-escalation and adherence to international
        law.He later criticised Western envoys who urged Pakistan to support the
        UN resolution against Russia.After his government's ouster, Khan stated
        that the visit had secured offers for discounted oil and wheat from
        Russia, although this was denied by the Russian Ambassador to Pakistan,
        who stated that no formal agreements had been signed.The ambassador
        suggested that the visit may have contributed to Khan's removal from
        power.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <h3>*Security And Terrorism</h3>
      <p>
        During Khan's tenure as Prime Minister of Pakistan, there was progress
        in improving security, as evidenced by a 13% reduction in terrorist
        attacks in 2019 compared to the previous year. Challenges remained in
        regions such as Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and concerns about
        terrorism financing persisted.In 2019, his government formally banned
        the Hafiz Saeed-led Jamaat-ud-Dawa and its affiliate Falah-e-Insaniat
        Foundation under the Anti-Terrorism Act, and arrested Saeed.The
        following year, foreign investors expressed greater confidence in
        Pakistan's improving security situation.
      </p>
      <h3>*Public Sector</h3>
      <p>
        Public sector reforms included Pakistan International Airlines achieving
        operational breakeven after "quite a long time" and golden handshake
        schemes for employees at Pakistan Steel Mills.
      </p>
      <h3>*Accountability</h3>
      <p>
        Khan's relationship with billionaire sugar baron Jahangir Tareen soured
        amid the 2020 sugar scandal, when Khan pushed for an investigation into
        the matter. The inquiry found that Tareen's company, JWD, received a
        substantial share of export subsidies between 2015 and 2018, which were
        linked to the rise in sugar prices. The rift between the two deepened,
        eventually leading to Tareen's self-imposed exile in London.<br /><br />

        In 2021, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) released its
        three-year performance report, revealing financial recoveries of Rs487
        billion.Pakistan's ranking on the Corruption Perceptions Index worsened
        from 117th in 2018 to 140th in 2021, leading to criticism of the
        effectiveness of Khan's anti-corruption measures.The Cabinet Division
        yearbook prepared in May 2022 revealed that the Assets Recovery Unit
        (ARU), established by Khan, was involved in recovering Rs426.4 billion
        in collaboration with agencies including NAB, with Rs389.5 billion being
        recovered under the supervision and assistance of the ARU. As shown in
        the yearbook, this amount was Rs93.9 billion more than the total amount
        recovered over the 17 years from 2000 to 2017. The yearbook clarified
        that the ARU did not directly recover assets but instead supported law
        enforcement agencies in the recovery process. Throughout Khan's tenure,
        the ARU faced criticism from the then-opposition, which demanded an
        audit of the unit.<br /><br />
        In 2023, The Daily Telegraph reported that Lt. General Asim Munir
        intended to investigate corruption allegations involving Khan's wife,
        Bushra Bibi, during Khan's tenure in June 2019. Shortly afterward, Munir
        was removed as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and
        replaced by Lt. General Faiz Hameed. Khan said Munir's proposed
        investigation was not the reason for his removal.
      </p>
      <h3>*Social Policy</h3>
      <br />
      "Further information: Ehsaas Programme and Sehat Sahulat Program"
      <p>
        Khan's government supported the restoration and construction of
        religious sites for minorities. In Quetta, a 200-year-old Gurdwara,
        previously used as a school for Muslim girls, was returned to the Sikh
        community after a prolonged legal battle, allowing worship for the first
        time in 73 years.His government also supported the construction and
        renovation of Sikh shrines, including the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib.Khan
        formally inaugurated the Kartarpur Corridor on 9 November 2019,
        providing visa-free access for Indian Sikh pilgrims. While the Pakistan
        Peoples Party (PPP) fully supported this initiative, the Pakistan Muslim
        League (N) (PML-N) criticised it, citing India's negative responses and
        tensions over Kashmir.<br /><br />
        Khan's government introduced the Single National Curriculum (SNC) to
        standardise the education system, initially targeting classes 1 to 5.The
        Sehat Sahulat Program was launched to provide free medical care, with
        over 7 million families in Punjab reportedly receiving coverage.The
        government also launched the Ehsaas Programme as a comprehensive social
        safety net. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ehsaas Emergency Cash
        Programme reportedly disbursed Rs. 175 billion to 14.6 million
        beneficiaries.The programme received praise from Michael Barber, who
        described it as a transparent, results-driven poverty alleviation
        model.<br /><br />
        Khan proposed measures regarding sexual violence, including the public
        hanging and chemical castration of convicted rapists.However, following
        objections from the Council of Islamic Ideology deeming chemical
        castration un-Islamic, the punishment was removed.
      </p>
      <h3>*COVID-19 Pandemic</h3>
      <br />
      "Further information: Corona Relief Tiger Force"<br />
      <p>
        During the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, Khan initially resisted a
        complete lockdown, citing Pakistan's economic vulnerability, where a
        quarter of the population lived in extreme poverty. Instead, his
        government implemented limited restrictions, such as closing educational
        institutions and restricting public gatherings, while also introducing
        screening procedures at airports. He stated that preparations had begun
        in January 2020 in anticipation of the virus's arrival from China.<br /><br />
        After Khan ruled out a lockdown in his 22 March 2020 address, the
        Pakistan Army intervened at the request of the provinces, imposing a
        nationwide lockdown within 24 hours. The military took charge of the
        COVID-19 response, establishing the National Core Committee to
        coordinate between the national and provincial governments. The Pakistan
        Army's spokesperson announced that, following government instructions,
        the army chief had ordered the deployment of all available troops to
        help contain the virus's spread.Analyst Ayesha Siddiqa described Khan as
        appearing confused and dependent on the military, which made key
        decisions without his involvement.<br /><br />
      </p>
      At the Iran–Pakistan border crossing, individuals quarantined under the
      government's procedures faced inadequate screening, overcrowding, and
      unsanitary conditions, contributing to the virus's spread.The government
      also faced allegations of corruption, including an investigation into his
      health adviser Zafar Mirza for allegedly smuggling 20 million face
      masks.<br /><br />
      Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme,distributing a lump sum
      of Rs12,000 to 10 million low-income citizens under the Ehsaas Programme.
      The initiative aimed to provide relief to daily wage earners affected by
      the pandemic.The programme was praised internationally, with the World
      Health Organization commending Pakistan's commitment to establishing
      temporary isolation wards.<br /><br />
      Khan also promoted a smart lockdown strategy, which used military
      technology for tracking and tracing COVID-19 cases, targeting specific
      virus hotspots instead of implementing a nationwide lockdown.He argued
      that strict lockdowns would devastate Pakistan's economy and lead to
      starvation.Murad Ali Shah, Sindh's chief minister, acknowledged his
      efforts to build consensus on lockdown measures.<br /><br />
      Fitch Ratings projected a decline in Pakistan's public debt-to-GDP ratio
      due to the rupee's appreciation and nominal GDP growth but highlighted
      fiscal vulnerabilities, with a government fiscal deficit of 7.5% of GDP in
      FY21 and an interest burden of 38.7% of revenue, far exceeding the B
      median.His government introduced tax relief measures, including reduced
      customs duty on industrial raw materials, leading to an estimated Rs119
      billion in foregone revenue, partially offset by a 17% sales tax on
      imported food and luxury goods.In July 2021, The Economist ranked Pakistan
      third on its normalcy index for pandemic response. The country's
      positivity rate for COVID-19 cases increased to over 3% on 7 July.<br /><br />
      <h3>*FATF Compliance</h3>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        In June 2018, before Khan became Prime Minister, Pakistan was placed on
        the FATF grey list due to deficiencies in anti-money laundering and
        counter-terrorism financing laws.His government introduced the
        Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill 2020 in Parliament.The opposition
        objected to specific provisions, including those granting authorities
        the power to arrest without a warrant and conduct covert operations.
        They described these as "draconian laws" that violated fundamental
        rights and claimed they exceeded FATF requirements.Khan criticized the
        opposition for blocking the bills, accusing them of seeking an NRO.By
        June 2021, 26 out of 27 points were addressed and FATF urged swift
        action to complete the final item.<br /><br />
        In June 2022, two months following Khan's ouster, FATF decided to remove
        Pakistan from the grey list, recognizing the completion of both the 2018
        and 2021 action plans.Khan credited his government for the achievement,
        particularly his former energy minister, Hammad Azhar, who led the FATF
        Coordination Committee.The Shehbaz Sharif government also claimed credit
        for the success, while The Express Tribune acknowledged that Khan's
        government had "done most of the work." Pakistan was officially removed
        from the grey list in October 2022 after a successful FATF on-site
        visit.

      <h2>Post-Premiership</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>2022 Toshakhana Reference Case</h3>
      <p>
        The Government of Pakistan, formed by the Pakistan Democratic Movement
        (PDM), filed the Toshakhana case against Imran Khan in August 2022,
        alleging that he had failed to disclose details of official gifts
        received during his premiership and the proceeds from their sale in his
        declarations to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP),and that he
        had not declared the proceeds for tax purposes.<br /><br />
        Of the gifts received, Khan reportedly retained 58 gifts, with only 14
        valued at over Rs 14,000 each. On 8 September, Khan rejected the
        allegations as misleading and false, and requested the ECP to dismiss
        the case. In his reply to the ECP, Khan stated that all purchases were
        lawfully declared in his tax returns and wealth statements. The ECP
        hearings were delayed as Khan's legal team sought extensions.<br /><br />
        On 21 October 2022, the ECP disqualified Khan under Article 63 of the
        Constitution, declaring that he had submitted a false statement and
        incorrect declaration of assets for the tax year 2020–21. A four-member
        ECP bench unanimously ruled that Khan had deliberately misled officials
        regarding Toshakhana gifts. The commission also ordered the initiation
        of criminal proceedings against him under various sections of the
        Election Act, 2017.
      </p>
      <h3>*Assassination Attempt</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        On 3 November 2022, Khan was shot in the leg in an assassination attempt
        in Wazirabad while leading a march towards Islamabad to demand early
        elections.One of his supporters was killed during the attack. The
        alleged perpetrator, identified as Muhammad Naveed, was overpowered by
        one of Khan's supporters, which threw off his aim.Naveed said that he
        had acted alone and had targeted Khan because he believed Khan was
        misleading the people.Khan blamed the incumbent government for the
        assassination plot, primarily Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior
        Minister Rana Sanaullah and the Director General Counter Intelligence of
        the Inter-Services Intelligence, Faisal Naseer, although he did not
        present any evidence to substantiate these claims. In response to these
        accusations, both government and military officials strongly denied any
        involvement in the attack. Federal Information Minister Maryam Aurangzeb
        refuted Khan's allegations, questioning how he could demand the
        resignation of these officials before an investigation had even begun.
        The Inter-Services Public Relations, the media wing of Pakistan's
        military, condemned the allegations, terming them baseless and
        irresponsible, and said that no one would be allowed to defame the
        military or its personnel. Sanaullah also rejected Khan's allegations,
        calling them grievous.
      </p>
      <h3>*Second Alleged Attempt</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Khan alleged that a trap had been set at the Federal Judicial Complex
        (FJC) on 18 March 2023, where he had arrived for a Toshakhana case
        hearing. He said that a colleague had signalled him to escape, having
        understood the situation to be a trap.In an audio message sent to
        journalists, Khan said that he had been waiting outside the FJC and was
        trying to enter, but the police's use of tear gas made it seem as if
        they did not want him to reach the court. Meanwhile, the Islamabad
        Police tweeted that upon Khan's arrival at the FJC, his supporters began
        pelting the police with stones, prompting them to respond with tear
        gas.Khan claimed that the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had taken
        control of the area around the FJC the night before.Despite waiting for
        five hours, he did not disembark from his vehicle. Khan said that the
        purpose of the 20 unknown individuals in plain shalwar kameez was
        another attempt on his life, similar to the Wazirabad attack.<br /><br />
        Khan also accused police, the Pakistan Rangers, and unidentified
        individuals of provoking his supporters to create chaos in order to use
        it as a cover to kill him. He condemned a police raid on his home in his
        absence, calling it unlawful and a violation of court orders, and added
        that the plan was orchestrated on the instructions of Maryam Nawaz.
      </p>
      <h3>*Arrests And Imprisonment</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        As a result of an arrest warrant issued by the district and sessions
        court in Islamabad, the Islamabad Police and the Lahore Police launched
        an operation to arrest Khan on 14 March 2023.On 9 May, Khan was arrested
        at the Islamabad High Court by paramilitary forces who stormed into the
        courthouse, in connection with his alleged role in the 190 million pound
        case. The case centres around corruption allegations claiming that Khan
        and his wife, Bushra Bibi, secured land worth billions of rupees from
        property tycoon Malik Riaz in exchange for a deal that allegedly caused
        the national exchequer to lose Rs50 billion (£190 million).The funds,
        originally recovered by the UK's National Crime Agency, were reportedly
        meant for the national treasury but were instead used to pay fines
        imposed on Riaz for acquiring government land at below-market rates. The
        couple, who are the sole trustees of the Al-Qadir Trust, are accused of
        benefiting from this settlement, including the acquisition of 458 kanals
        of land for Al-Qadir University in Jhelum.<br /><br />
        On 5 August 2023, Khan was arrested for the second time and sentenced to
        three years' imprisonment after being found guilty of misusing his
        premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession, received during
        visits abroad and valued at more than 140 million rupees.On 29 August
        2023, an appeals court suspended Khan's corruption conviction and
        three-year prison term, and granted him bail. A special court ordered
        that he remain incarcerated in connection with the cypher case,which was
        registered by the Federal Investigation Agency for leaking state secrets
        and thereby violating the Official Secrets Act.<br /><br />
        In August 2023, the government submitted a report to the Supreme Court
        of Pakistan, stating that Khan's daily meals included bread, omelette,
        curd, and tea for breakfast, along with fresh fruits, vegetables,
        pulses, rice, and desi mutton cooked in ghee for lunch and dinner. His
        cell was cleaned daily by a designated sanitary worker, and additional
        security personnel were deployed for his safety. The Supreme Court had
        ordered the government to submit this report following Khan's complaints
        about the conditions in which he was being held.<br /><br />
        On 30 January 2024,Khan was convicted and sentenced to 10 years'
        imprisonment in the cypher case.Khan described all the charges against
        him as "politically motivated."The next day, Khan was convicted and
        sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment for the Toshakhana case,which
        involved the illegal sale of state gifts given to him and his wife,
        Bushra Bibi, when he was prime minister.The sentence was suspended on 1
        April pending an appeal.On 3 February, Khan and his wife were convicted
        and sentenced to an additional seven years in prison and fined 500,000
        rupees ($1,800) each following a criminal complaint by Bushra Bibi's
        former husband, Khawar Maneka, saying that Bushra did not complete her
        Iddat before marrying Khan in 2018.On 16 February, his legal team filed
        an appeal against the three consecutive convictions.<br /><br />
        Since his arrest in August, Khan has been held in the Adiala Jail in
        Rawalpindi, where his trial was also held.On 8 February, a PTI official
        said Khan had been allowed to vote in prison for the 2024 Pakistani
        general election using a postal ballot.On 12 March 2024, the Government
        of Punjab imposed a two-week ban on visits to the prison.

        On 30 May 2024, Khan told the Supreme Court that he was living in
        solitary confinement and the government had put restrictions on his
        meeting with lawyers and family members. The Pakistani government told
        the Supreme Court in June that the conditions of Khan's imprisonment
        included a walking area adjacent to his cell, a cooler, a television,
        and exercise equipment. It said that Khan has access to a separate
        kitchen and could meet with his legal team and family. In its
        submission, the government provided photographs of Khan's cell and other
        items and a photo of a meeting between him and his legal team in
        prison.<br /><br />
        On 3 June 2024, the Islamabad High Court overturned Khan's conviction on
        the cypher case.Khan remained in prison due to his conviction for a
        breach of the marriage laws.On 13 July, Khan's conviction in the
        marriage case with Bushra Bibi was overturned following an appeal. Khan
        remained in prison and was then arrested on charges related to the 2023
        riots.<br /><br />
        In June 2024, a United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention
        called for Khan's release, arguing that his detention was arbitrary and
        politically motivated.Amnesty International raised similar concerns,
        particularly over the conditions of his imprisonment.In an interview
        with The Sunday Times in July from prison, Khan said he is being held in
        a small, 'death cell' typically reserved for terrorists.Khan's legal
        team and his sister, Aleema Khan, said that the authorities are
        endangering his health and attempting to weaken him by keeping him in
        poor conditions, she also stated that Khan was suffering from an eye
        infection. A regular medical examination is performed every two weeks,
        and no health issues have been reported during his imprisonment by
        authorities.<br /><br />
        On 8 October 2024, an attempted murder charge was filed against him over
        the death of a police officer during protests by Khan's supporters in
        Islamabad.<br /><br />

        On 22 November 2024, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted Khan bail in
        the Toshakhana case, but he was not released from jail due to multiple
        other cases against him.On 24 November, his supporters marched
        nationwide, demanding his release.<br /><br />
        Since the 2022 no-confidence vote, Khan has been named in 186 legal
        cases across Pakistan, as reported by the Ministry of Interior,
        Islamabad Police, Federal Investigation Agency, and National
        Accountability Bureau to court in December 2024.<br /><br />
        On 17 January 2025, Khan was sentenced to 14 years in prison by an
        accountability court in the Al-Qadir Trust case, while his wife, Bushra
        Bibi, received a seven-year jail term.<br /><br />

        In February 2025, after a meeting with Imran Khan in prison, his sister
        Aleema Khan said, "here is no truth in the reports [doing the rounds in
        the media] claiming that the PTI founder is ill," when questioned about
        Khan's health and added that Bushra Bibi was being kept in solitary
        confinement.

      <h3>*University Of Oxford Chancellor Candidacy</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains politically active, having
        applied to run in the 2024 University of Oxford Chancellor Election. His
        candidacy has gained attention, with supporters promoting the campaign
        on social media.<br /><br />
        Khan's candidacy also attracted some concerns due to timing, coinciding
        with ongoing political unrest in Pakistan and his imprisonment on
        multiple charges, including corruption and sedition at the time. His
        supporters argue these charges are politically motivated, critics
        suggested that his legal battles and the broader political context might
        distract from his ability to focus on the responsibilities of the role.
        Some observers saw his candidacy as a way to draw international
        attention to his political situation and about whether his motivations
        are primarily political rather than academic.<br /><br />
        On 16 October 2024, university officials excluded him from the race of
        chancellorship stating that his candidacy was disqualified based on
        established exclusion criteria, which led to the acceptance of 38 out of
        over 40 applicants. Key factors cited include Khan's prior conviction
        and his active political role, which were seen as inconsistent with the
        requirements for the position. Legal analysis from King's Counsel Hugh
        Southey of Matrix Chambers, as well as policy advocacy group Beltway
        Grid, said that Oxford's regulations set standards of integrity and
        impartiality that Khan did not meet.

      <h2>Wealth And Assets</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In 1983, Khan bought a two-bedroom penthouse in South Kensington for
        £110,000. He sold it in 2003 to purchase nearly 35 acres in Islamabad,
        where he built a farmhouse.In his statement to the Election Commission
        of Pakistan (ECP) that year, Khan declared his home in Zaman Park,
        Lahore, an apartment in Islamabad, 39 kanals of land in Islamabad, 530
        kanals in Khanewal, and a share in 363 kanals of inherited agricultural
        land.<br /><br />
        In 2017, Khan's 300-kanal mansion in Bani Gala, Islamabad, was worth Rs.
        750 million (US$2.6 million), which he declared as a gift in his
        statement to the ECP. Other assets included furniture worth Rs. 0.6
        million (US$2,100) and livestock valued at Rs. 0.2 million (US$690).In
        2020, the ECP released another report on Khan's assets, stating that he
        declared assets worth Rs80.6 million which included a six-kanal plot in
        Mohra Noori and five inherited plots in Mianwali, Bhakkar, Sheikhupura,
        and Khanewal. He sold his property in Ferozewala for Rs70 million.
        Additionally, he purchased a two-bed apartment on Shahrah-e-Dastoor for
        Rs10.19 million. Khan had Rs50.66 million in a bank account in Pakistan
        and Rs10.99 million in cash. He also maintained four foreign currency
        accounts, holding £518, $328,760, and $1,470, with an empty euro
        account. His declared assets included four goats valued at Rs200,000.<br /><br />
        In his nomination papers for the 2024 Pakistani general election, Khan
        declared that he holds over Rs90 million in multiple bank accounts and
        over $300,000 in his foreign currency account. He owns over a dozen
        properties, mostly inherited, including agricultural land and his home
        in Zaman Park.Khan made a down payment of Rs11.97 million for the
        apartment on Shahrah-e-Dastoor and listed Rs11.47 million in expenses
        for his home in Bani Gala. He declared that he does not own a vehicle.
      </p>
      <h3>*Taxes</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Tax records released by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) disclosed
        that between 1983 and 2019, Khan paid Rs. 4 million in taxes. The board
        said that Khan had been exempt from paying for some years.In January
        2022, the FBR published its 2019 tax directory for parliamentarians,
        disclosing that Khan paid Rs. 9.8 million (equivalent to Rs. 50 million
        or US$172,727 in 2021) in taxes.For the fiscal year ending on 30 June
        2023, Khan's tax contributions increased significantly reaching Rs.
        15.59 million (equivalent to Rs. 79 million or US$270,000 in 2021) as
        his net worth rose to Rs315.95 million. In 2022, his income was
        Rs185.68m, due to the sale of a watch gifted to him by a foreign
        dignitary. The year before, his income was over Rs7 million.
      </p>
      <h2>Political Views</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Domestic Policies</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Khan's proclaimed political platform and declarations include Islamic
        values, to which he rededicated himself in the 1990s; leftist economics,
        with the promise of addressing economic disparity and promoting social
        welfare; decreased bureaucracy and the implementation of anti-corruption
        laws to create and ensure a clean government; the establishment of an
        independent judiciary; overhaul of the country's police system; and an
        anti-militant vision for a democratic Pakistan. However, Khan's
        political journey has been marked by inconsistency, including his
        support for General Musharraf's military regime before later opposing
        it.<br /><br />
        A US diplomatic cable from January 2010 released by WikiLeaks, revealed
        that US Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson met with Khan at his
        residence, where Khan criticised the United States for its "dangerous"
        policies, including drone operations. Another leaked cable referring to
        Khan, stated: "the man says in private exactly what he says in
        public".<br /><br />
        In a 2012 interview with Barkha Dutt, Khan referred to liberals in
        Pakistan as the "scum of the country" and labeled them as fascists. Khan
        said that these liberals supported the bombardment and drone attacks on
        villages. He added that it was the liberals who backed the United
        States' policies including the War on Terror that had contributed to the
        rise of extremism in the country.
      </p>
      <h2>Authorship</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Khan has published six works of non-fiction, including an autobiography
        co-written with Patrick Murphy. In the late 1980s, he served as editor
        of The Cricketer, a London-based cricket magazine. He periodically wrote
        editorials on cricket and Pakistani politics in several leading
        Pakistani and British newspapers. It was revealed in 2008 that Khan's
        second book, Indus Journey: A Personal View of Pakistan, had required
        heavy editing from the publisher. The publisher, Jeremy Lewis, revealed
        in a memoir that when he asked Khan to show his writing for publication,
        "He handed me a leather-bound notebook or diary containing a few
        jottings and autobiographical snippets. It took me, at most, five
        minutes to read them; and that, it soon became apparent, was all we had
        to go on." Khan's autobiography was published in 2011, detailing his
        transition from cricketer to politician, as well as the challenges he
        faced in his philanthropic work.<br /><br />
        Khan has also penned op-eds in various media outlets, including CNN
        where he advocated for conversation and restoration of damaged natural
        ecosystems.<br /><br />
        "Khan's publications include:"<br /><br />
