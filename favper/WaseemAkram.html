      <p>
        <strong><h2>Wasim Akram</h2></strong>Wasim Akram HI (Punjabi, Urdu:
        وَسیم اکرم; born 3 June 1966) is a Pakistani cricket commentator, coach,
        and former cricketer and captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.
        Akram is regarded as one of the greatest bowlers of all time. He is
        often revered as The Sultan of Swing.In October 2013, Wasim Akram was
        the only Pakistani cricketer to be named in an all-time Test World XI to
        mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.As captain, he
        led Pakistan to the finals of the 1999 Cricket World Cup, where they
        lost to Australia by 8 wickets. He was a part of the Pakistani squad
        which won the 1992 Cricket World Cup.<br />
        A left-arm fast bowler who could bowl with significant pace, he holds
        the world record for most wickets in List A cricket, with 881, and is
        second only to Sri Lankan off-spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan in terms
        of ODI wickets, with 502 in total. He is considered to be one of the
        founders, and perhaps the finest exponent of, reverse swing bowling.<br />
        He was the first bowler to reach the 500-wicket mark in ODI cricket, and
        he did so during the 2003 World Cup. In 2002, Wisden released its only
        list of the best players of all time. Wasim was ranked as the best
        bowler in ODI of all time, with a rating of 1223.5, ahead of Allan
        Donald, Imran Khan, Waqar Younis, Joel Garner, Glenn McGrath and
        Muralitharan.Wasim took 23 four-wicket hauls in 356 ODI matches played.
      </p>

      <h1>Early And Personal Life</h1>
      <h3>*Family Background</h3>
      <p>
        Wasim Akram was born on 3 June 1966 to a Punjabi family in Lahore.
        Akram's father, Chaudhary Muhammad Akram Arain, was originally from a
        village near Amritsar and the family moved to Pakistani Punjab after the
        partition of India in 1947.Their ancestral village is called Chawinda
        Devi and the family belongs to the Arain community.<br />
        His father's first job was as a court proofreader and he also operated
        an automotive spare parts business while for some time he ran a
        single-screen cinema, the Niagara, located in the Ferozepur Road,
        because of which Akram would develop an early love for Hindi cinema.<br />
        His mother's name is Begum Akram, and he has three siblings: two elder
        brothers Naeem Akram and Nadeem Akram and a younger sister, Sofia Akram.
      </p>

      <h3>*Education</h3>
      <p>
        He completed his early education in Lahore from Government Islamia
        College, Civil Lines, Lahore.
      </p>

      <h3>*Health</h3>
      <p>
        At the age of 30, Akram was diagnosed with diabetes. "I remember what a
        shock it was because I was a healthy sportsman with no history of
        diabetes in my family, so I didn't expect it at all. It seemed strange
        that it happened to me when I was 30, but it was a very stressful time
        and doctors said that can trigger it."Since then he has sought to be
        involved in various awareness campaigns for diabetes.
      </p>

      <h3>*Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        Akram married Huma Mufti in 1995.They had two sons from their marriage
        of 14 years: Tahmoor and Akbar.Huma died of multiple organ failure at
        Apollo Hospital in Chennai, India, on 25 October 2009.<br />
        For some years he was linked by the Indian media to former Miss Universe
        turned actress Sushmita Sen.<br />
        On 7 July 2013, it was reported that Akram had become engaged to an
        Australian woman, Shaniera Thompson, whom he had met while on a visit to
        Melbourne in 2011. Akram married Shaniera on 12 August 2013, saying he
        has started a new life on a happy note. He was quoted as saying, "I
        married Shaniera in Lahore in a simple ceremony, and this is the start
        of a new life for me, my wife, and for my kids."<br />
        He moved from Lahore to Karachi with his wife and children. On 3
        September 2014, the couple tweeted that they were expecting their first
        baby—the third child of Akram.On 27 December 2014, Shaniera gave birth
        to a baby girl, Aiyla Sabeen Rose Akram, in Melbourne.
      </p>

      <h1>Domestic Career</h1>
      <p>
        Akram started his career as a tape ball cricketer.[31] He later joined
        Ludhiana Gymkhana with the help of his friend, Khalid Mahmood.His first
        class cricket debut was for BCCP Patron's Eleven against New Zealand
        cricket team.<br />
        In 1988, Akram signed for Lancashire County Cricket Club in England.
        From 1988 to 1998, he opened their bowling attack in their NatWest
        Trophy, Benson and Hedges Cup, and Sunday League tournaments. He was a
        favourite of the local British fans, who used to sing a song called
        "Wasim for England" at Lancashire's matches. In 1998, with Akram as
        captain, Lancashire won the NatWest Trophy and Sunday League and
        finished second in the County Championship, having lost only five
        matches in all competitions during the season.
      </p>

      <h1>International Career</h1>
      <br />
      <h3>*Test Cricket</h3>
      <p>
        Akram made his Test cricket debut for Pakistan against New Zealand in
        1985,and in his second Test match, he claimed 10 wickets.A few weeks
        prior to his selection in the Pakistan team, he was an unknown club
        cricketer who had failed to make it even to his college team. He came to
        the trials at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore in Pakistan, but for the first
        two days he did not get a chance to bowl. On the third day, he got a
        chance; his performance convincing Javed Miandad to insist upon his
        inclusion in the national team.Akram was hence given an opportunity to
        play for Pakistan, without any significant domestic experience.<br />
        Akram's rise in international cricket was rapid during the late 1980s.
        He was a part of the Pakistan team that toured the West Indies in 1988.
        However, a groin injury impeded his career in the late 1980s. Following
        two surgeries, he re-emerged in the 1990s as a fast bowler who focused
        more on swing and accurate bowling.<br />
        Wasim Akram is currently the highest wicket taker for Pakistan in test
        cricket with 414 wickets.
      </p>

      <h3>*One Day International</h3>
      <p>
        Akram started his ODI career against New Zealand in Pakistan in 1984
        under the captaincy of Zaheer Abbas.He rose to prominence by taking five
        wickets in his 3rd ODI against Australia in the 1985 Benson & Hedges
        World Championship. His wickets included those of Kepler Wessels, Dean
        Jones, and captain Allan Border. Wasim Akram is currently the highest
        wicket taker for Pakistan in One Day International cricket.
      </p>

      <h3>*Early Days</h3>
      <p>
        In the 1984–85 Rothmans Four-Nations Cup and the 1985–86 Rothmans
        Sharjah Cup, Akram took five wickets with a run rate of less than 3.50.
        The 1985–1986 Austral-Asia Cup involved Australia, India, New Zealand,
        Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and was played in Sharjah, UAE. Akram, with the
        help of Abdul Qadir, bowled out New Zealand's batting line-up for 64 in
        the second semi-final of the cup. Pakistan won that game with more than
        27 overs to spare, obtaining one of the biggest wins in Pakistani
        history. In the final against India, he and Imran Khan shared five
        wickets. Akram's wickets included Dilip Vengsarkar and Ravi Shastri.<br />
        In the 1987 Cricket World Cup held for the 1st time in South Asia, Akram
        struggled on Pakistani pitches; he managed only 7 wickets throughout,
        with an average of over 40 runs per wicket across all 7 matches. Akram
        played West Indies, Sri Lanka and England twice. All group matches were
        played in Pakistan.<br />
        In the 1988–89 Benson and Hedges World Series, Akram managed figures of
        4 for 25 against Australia.
      </p>
      <h3>*Emergence</h3>
      <p>
        Akram took his hundredth wicket at Sharjah during the 1989–1990
        Champions Trophy, the 2nd Match against West Indies. His 100th wicket
        was that of Curtly Ambrose. In that match, he took a five-wicket haul
        for the second time in his career.In the same match, Akram took his
        first hat-trick against West Indies. All three batsman were bowled
        out.On 4 May 1990 in Sharjah, Akram took his second ODI hat-trick
        against Australia. All three batsmen were bowled this time as well.<br />
        His best years in the late 1980s were from 1986 to 1989, during which
        time he took 100 wickets at 22.71 runs per wicket, and his economy rate
        was less than 3.9 runs per over, with a total of four 4-wicket hauls.
        His first two hauls against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh came in Sri Lanka
        in 1986.<br />
        Up until December 1991, Akram took 143 wickets in 107 matches, with an
        average of almost 24 and an economy rate of 3.84.
      </p>
      <h3>*World's Best</h3>
      <p>
        Akram was a significant figure in the 1992 Cricket World Cup held in
        Australia and New Zealand when Pakistan won the tournament. In the
        final, against England, his innings of 33 runs off 19 balls pushed
        Pakistan to a score of 249 runs for 6 wickets. Akram then took the
        wicket of Ian Botham early on during the English batting innings; and,
        when brought back into the bowling attack later on, with the ball
        reverse swinging, he produced a spell of bowling which led to Allan Lamb
        and Chris Lewis being bowled in successive deliveries in one over. His
        performances earned him the Man of the Match award for the final.In
        1993, Akram took two consecutive 4-wicket hauls against Sri Lanka in
        Sharjah, in which 7 out of 8 wickets were either LBW or bowled.<br />
        In the 1992–1993 Total International Series in South Africa (involving
        Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa), he took 5 wickets against South
        Africa and got his 200th wicket in his 143rd match.Akram took 46 wickets
        in calendar year 1993, his best year ever in ODIs. His average was less
        than 19, with an economy rate of less than 3.8 runs per over. He took
        six 4-wicket hauls in 1993, the most by him in any year.In the 1996
        Cricket World Cup, Akram missed the quarterfinal match against India
        which Pakistan lost and went out of the World Cup. Wasim's great career
        was often tainted by controversy, not least in the Caribbean in April
        1993, his maiden tour as Pakistan's captain. During the team's stop-over
        in Grenada, he was arrested along with three teammates—Waqar Younis,
        Aaqib Javed and Mushtaq Ahmed—and two female British tourists; he was
        charged with possession of marijuana.Between 1994 and 1996, he took 84
        wickets in 39 matches.<br />
        From January 1992 to December 1997, Akram played 131 matches and took
        198 wickets at an average of 21.86, with 14 4-wicket hauls in ODIs. In
        September 1998, he first announced his retirement from international
        cricket and hired a retired judge to help him fight match-fixing
        allegations levelled against him. Akram called the allegations "a
        conspiracy, especially within the board". He added, "Unfortunately I
        have to leave cricket. When allegations arise you need to fight it out.
        You can't just sit back.... I would love to carry on but I simply can't.
        But I'm happy because I know that I have done nothing wrong."However, he
        reconsidered his decision on the insistence of chairman of the Pakistan
        Cricket Board (PCB), Khalid Mahmood.
      </p>
      <h3>*Late Career</h3>
      <p>
        In 1999, he led Pakistan to the finals of the World Cup where they
        capitulated and were defeated by Australia in the final by eight wickets
        with almost 30 overs to spare.This was the start of the match-fixing
        controversies, as critics believed Akram had set up the match for
        Australia. However, none of the allegations could be proven.<br />
        He was Pakistan's best bowler in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, taking 12
        wickets in 6 matches.However, Pakistan failed to reach the super six of
        the tournament, and Akram was one of the eight players to be sacked by
        the PCB as a result.
      </p>
      <h1>Records</h1>
      <p>
        Akram won 17 Man-of-the-Match awards in 104 Tests. He took four
        hat-tricks in international cricket—two in ODIs and two in Tests. As a
        result, he shares the record for most international hat-tricks with
        Lasith Malinga.He finished with 22 Man-of-the-Match awards in ODIs. In
        199 ODI match wins, he took 326 wickets at under 19 apiece with a run
        rate of 3.70 and took 18 four-wicket hauls.His 257 not-out against
        Zimbabwe in 1996 is the highest innings by a number-8 batsman in Tests.
        He hit 12 sixes in that game, and it stands to this day as the record
        for the most sixes by any player in a single Test innings.<br />
        Prior to his retirement, he was one of eight senior players dropped for
        the 2003 Sharjah Cup, and was then omitted from the Pakistan squad for
        the subsequent Bank Alfalah Cup triangular series.Due to his omission
        from the team, he did not participate in a farewell match. Akram
        fulfilled his contract play for Hampshire until the end of the English
        season.
      </p>
      <h1>Post-Retirement</h1>
      <h3>*Media Career</h3>
      <p>
        Since retiring from cricket, Akram has worked and taken up commentary
        for television networks and can currently be seen as a sports
        commentator for ESPN Star Sports and ARY Digital among others. He did
        commentary on a variety of sporting tournaments including the 2009
        Women's Cricket World Cup in Australia, the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in
        England, the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa, and the 2011 ICC
        World Cup in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
      </p>
      <h3>*Coaching Career</h3>
      <p>
        In 2010, Akram was appointed the bowling coach consultant of Kolkata
        Knight Riders, the Indian Premier League team for Kolkata. Sourav
        Ganguly was always keen to have Akram as the bowling coach for India,
        during the former's stint as Indian captain. Although this never
        happened, his dreams were realised to some extent, when Akram was
        appointed as the bowling coach cum mentor for the franchise.Akram has
        thus been playing a vital role in the grooming of Indian pacers like
        Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav, who owe their success in international
        cricket a lot to the bowling legend. While working for the Kolkata
        Knight Riders, he was also responsible for the signing of Pakistani
        domestic left-arm fast-bowler Mohammad Irfan.Akram has also been
        coaching in Pakistan fast bowling camps, his most notable discovery
        being the teenage Pakistani bowlers Mohammad Amir and Junaid Khan. Akram
        has also worked as director and bowling coach of PSL franchise Islamabad
        United during 2016 and 2017 season. He has also worked with Multan
        Sultans as director and bowling coach. He is currently chairman and
        bowling coach of Karachi Kings.He is also currently the Vice President
        of Kashmir Premier League.

      <h1>Playing Style And Legacy</h1>
      <p>
        During his professional career he bowled with genuine speed and
        hostility. Akram was a man possessed of accurate control of line and
        length, accompanied by seam and swing bowling skills, extended to both
        inswingers and outswingers. With a very quick bowling action, he could
        bowl equally well from both sides of the wicket. His mastery of reverse
        swing with the cricket ball meant he was at his most dangerous towards
        the end of a bowling innings, and earned him the nickname of one of the
        "Sultans of Swing", the other one being Waqar Younis.<br />
        As well as often being able to find the edge of the bat, Akram would
        also focus his bowling attack on the stumps and had a particularly
        lethal inswinging yorker. Of his 414 Test wickets, 193 were taken
        caught, 119 were taken leg before wicket and 102 were bowled.In
        partnership with Waqar Younis, he intimidated international batsmen in
        the 1990s. Together Wasim and Waqar, known as "the two Ws" of the
        Pakistani team, were one of the most successful bowling partnerships in
        cricket.<br />
        With the bat he was especially effective against spin bowlers. However,
        he liked to slog and was criticised for his lack of high scores and
        giving away his wicket too cheaply. In October 1996 he scored 257 runs
        not out, of the team's total of 553 against lowly Zimbabwe on a typical
        flat South Asian pitch at Sheikhupura. He also achieved good scores for
        the Pakistan team such as his scores of 123 and 45* against Australia to
        take Pakistan to victory in a low scoring match. His batting was also
        valuable sometimes to the Pakistan ODI side, such as in the Nehru Cup in
        1989, when needing six runs in two balls to win the match, he hit the
        first delivery he faced, from part-time off-spinner and batting legend,
        Viv Richards, for a six and secured the cup.<br />
        West Indian batting great Viv Richards rates Akram as best fast bowler
        he ever faced after Dennis Lillee.<br />
        In December 2012 after Ricky Ponting announced his retirement, he said
        that Wasim Akram and Curtly Ambrose were the toughest bowlers he had
        faced"Akram for the exact opposite, you could get a few runs off him,
        but you just knew there was an unplayable ball around the corner, be it
        with an old ball or with a new ball," – Ricky Ponting.<br />
        To mark 150 years of the Cricketers' Almanack, Wisden named him in an
        all-time Test World XI.

      <h1>Award And Records</h1>
      <p>
        Akram was awarded Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1993 for his sporting
        achievements. He was awarded Lux Style Award for Most Stylish Sports
        Person in 2003.<br />

        *In his Test career, Akram took 414 wickets in 104 matches, a Pakistani
        record, at an average of 23.62 and scored 2,898 runs, at an average of
        22.64.<br />

        *In One Day Internationals, Akram took 502 wickets in 356 appearances,
        at an average of 23.52 and scored 3,717 runs, at an average of 16.52.<br />

        *Akram was the first bowler in international cricket to take more than
        400 wickets in both forms of the game and only Muttiah Muralitharan has
        since achieved this.<br />

        *Akram also held the record for the most wickets in Cricket World Cups,
        a total of 55 in 38 matches. Australia's Glenn McGrath broke the record
        during the 2007 Cricket World Cup, ending with a final tally of 71 from
        39 matches.[103] On passing Wasim's record, McGrath said, "Wasim Akram,
        to me, is one of the greatest bowlers of all time. Left-armer, swung it
        both ways with the new ball and he was so dangerous with the old ball.
        To go past him is something I will always remember. Probably the other
        side of the coin is that if you play long enough, you're going to break
        records here and there." He is currently the fourth highest wicket taker
        in world cups.<br />
        *Akram is one of the only two bowlers, along with Lasith Malinga, that
        achieved four or more hat-tricks in international cricket, with two each
        in Tests and One Day Internationals. He was the third of only four
        bowlers to have taken two Test cricket hat-tricks, the others being Hugh
        Trumble, Jimmy Matthews and Stuart Broad. Akram was also the first of
        only five bowlers to have taken two One Day International cricket
        hat-tricks. Akram's Test hat-tricks are significant, since they were
        taken in consecutive Test matches in the same series, a game played
        against Sri Lanka in the 1998-99 Asian Test Championship. Akram is also
        one of only two bowlers to have taken both a Test match and One Day
        International hat-trick, the other being Pakistan fast bowler, Mohammad
        Sami.<br />

        *Playing in a Test series against the West Indies at Lahore in
        1990–1991, he became one of only six players to have taken four wickets
        in an over during a Test match. In Akram's case, these achievement was
        not part of a hat-trick, the third ball he delivered to the batting
        opposition was a dropped catch, which allowed a single run.<br />

        *Akram has also achieved the highest score by a number eight batsman in
        Test cricket when he scored 257 runs not out from 363 balls against
        Zimbabwe at Sheikhupura. The innings contained 12 sixes which is also a
        world record for highest number of sixes in any Test innings.<br />

        *He also has the joint-third highest number of Man of the Match awards
        in Test cricket, with seventeen.<br />

        *He has scored the second-highest number of runs in One Day
        International matches by a player who has never scored a One Day
        International hundred, after Misbah-ul-Haq. His highest score was 86
        runs.<br />

        *He is the only Test cricketer in the world (as of Feb 2013) to take ten
        or more wickets three times in a test match and still end up on the
        losing side.<br />

        *He holds the record for facing the most balls in a test match as well
        as in an innings as number 8 batsman (363 balls).<br />

        *First bowler to take 500 ODI wickets and still holds the record for
        taking the most ODI wickets as seamer (502).<br />

        *Wasim Akram is the person to grab 100+ ODI wickets at the same ground.
        He jointly holds the record for taking the most wickets in ODI history
        at a single ground (122 at Sharjah Cricket Stadium), tied with Shakib Al
        Hasan.<br />

        *Waqar Younis, the second person to grab 100+ ODI wickets at a single
        ground, also did in Sharjah. He ranks second overall with 114 wickets.
        <br />

        *Holds the record for taking the most ODI wickets as captain.

      <h1>Controversies</h1>
      <h3>*Ball Tampering</h3>
      <p>
        In 1992, after he had been successful against the English batsmen,
        accusations of ball tampering began to appear in the English media,
        though no video evidence of foul play was ever found. Akram and Younis
        had been able to obtain prodigious amounts of movement from both new and
        old cricket balls. The skill of the reverse swing delivery was
        relatively unknown in England and around the cricketing world during
        that period.
      </p>
      <h3>*Match Fixing</h3>
      <p>
        A far larger controversy was created when critics alleged that he was
        involved in match fixing. An inquiry commission was set up by the
        Pakistan Cricket Board headed by a Pakistan high court judge, Malik
        Mohammad Qayyum. The judge wrote in his report that.<br />
        This commission feels that all is not well here and that Wasim Akram is
        not above board. He has not co-operated with this Commission. It is only
        by giving Wasim Akram the benefit of the doubt after Ata-ur-Rehman
        changed his testimony in suspicious circumstances that he has not been
        found guilty of match-fixing. He cannot be said to be above suspicion.
      </p>
      <h1>Autobiography</h1>
      <p>
        Akram's autobiography, titled Sultan: A Memoir, co-authored by cricket
        writer Gideon Haigh, was published in 2022 by HarperCollins.
