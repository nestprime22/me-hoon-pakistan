    <p><strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong> (25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was the founder of Pakistan and served as its first Governor-General. He is revered in Pakistan as Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). A barrister by profession, Jinnah played a pivotal role in the independence of Pakistan and is considered one of the most influential leaders of South Asia.</p>
    
    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>Jinnah was born in Karachi, then part of British India, into a merchant family of Gujarati Khoja Muslims. He received his early education from the Sindh Madressatul Islam and later the Christian Missionary School in Karachi. At the age of 16, he was sent to London, where he studied law at Lincoln's Inn. He became the youngest Indian to be called to the bar in England in 1896.</p>
    
    <h2>Legal and Political Beginnings</h2>
    <p>After returning to India, Jinnah began a successful career as a barrister in Bombay. He joined the Indian National Congress in 1906, where he was a strong advocate of Hindu-Muslim unity. He supported constitutional reforms and played a key role in the Lucknow Pact of 1916, which was a historic agreement between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League.</p>
    
    <h2>Role in the All-India Muslim League</h2>
    <p>Though Jinnah initially promoted unity between Hindus and Muslims, over time he became disillusioned with the Congress Party's treatment of Muslims. In 1913, he formally joined the Muslim League and began advocating for the rights and political representation of Muslims in India. His famous Fourteen Points, presented in 1929, highlighted the key demands of Indian Muslims and laid the foundation for the idea of a separate Muslim state.</p>
    
    <h2>The Two-Nation Theory and Pakistan Movement</h2>
    <p>Jinnah emerged as the central figure in the demand for an independent Muslim homeland, based on the belief that Muslims and Hindus were two distinct nations with different religions, cultures, and traditions. This idea was known as the Two-Nation Theory. He led the Muslim League to pass the Lahore Resolution in 1940, which called for separate states for Muslims in the northwestern and eastern zones of India. His leadership during this time was instrumental in mobilizing public opinion and organizing political campaigns for Pakistan.</p>
    
    <h2>Negotiations and Partition of India</h2>
    <p>During the 1940s, Jinnah engaged in several negotiations with the British government and the Indian National Congress, including the Cripps Mission and the Cabinet Mission Plan. Despite efforts to find a unified solution, talks failed due to irreconcilable differences. Following violent communal riots and the failure of power-sharing proposals, the British decided to partition India. Pakistan was officially created on 14 August 1947, with Jinnah as its first Governor-General.</p>
    
    <h2>Leadership as Governor-General</h2>
    <p>As Governor-General, Jinnah faced enormous challenges: resettling millions of refugees, establishing administrative infrastructure, and maintaining law and order in a fragile, newly born country. Despite suffering from tuberculosis, he worked tirelessly to shape Pakistan into a democratic and inclusive state. He stressed religious tolerance and unity in several public addresses, including his famous speech to the Constituent Assembly on 11 August 1947.</p>
    
    <h2>Health Decline and Death</h2>
    <p>Jinnah had been battling tuberculosis for years, a fact known to only a few close aides. His health deteriorated rapidly after independence, but he continued to lead until the very end. On 11 September 1948, barely a year after Pakistan’s creation, he passed away in Karachi. His funeral was attended by hundreds of thousands, and his death was mourned across the nation.</p>
    
    <h2>Vision for Pakistan</h2>
    <p>Jinnah envisioned Pakistan as a democratic, progressive, and tolerant state. He emphasized that religion was a personal matter and that all citizens, regardless of faith, should have equal rights. In his 11 August 1947 speech, he declared:</p>
    <blockquote>
    “You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques... You may belong to any religion, caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the state.”
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
    <p>Jinnah is widely regarded as one of the greatest political leaders of the 20th century. His unwavering resolve, legal brilliance, and diplomatic skills led to the formation of the world’s first nation established in the name of Islam. He is remembered not only as a political leader but as a symbol of determination, justice, and nationhood. His portrait is displayed in all government offices in Pakistan, and his mausoleum in Karachi is a national monument.</p>
    
    <h2>Famous Quotes</h2>
    <blockquote>
    "There is no power on earth that can undo Pakistan."<br><br>
    "With faith, discipline and selfless devotion to duty, there is nothing worthwhile that you cannot achieve."<br><br>
    "My message to you all is of hope, courage and confidence."<br><br>
    "We are all equal citizens of one State."
    </blockquote>
