    <p><strong>Abdul Sattar Edhi</strong> (1 January 1928 – 8 July 2016) was Pakistan’s most respected humanitarian, known for his tireless work in caring for the poor, sick, abandoned, and homeless. Founder of the Edhi Foundation, he dedicated his entire life to helping others, regardless of race, religion, or status. Often referred to as the “Angel of Mercy,” Edhi built the largest volunteer-run ambulance network in the world and provided countless social services to the nation.</p>

    <h2>Early Life and Inspiration</h2>
    <p>Born in Bantva, Gujarat (India), Edhi moved to Pakistan after the Partition in 1947. His mother’s illness during his youth had a lasting impact on him, developing his sense of empathy. Arriving in Karachi with almost nothing, he began helping people with just a small dispensary, later expanding his mission with donated funds and personal sacrifice.</p>

    <h2>Building the Edhi Foundation</h2>
    <p>In 1951, Edhi founded the Edhi Foundation — a non-profit that grew to include orphanages, hospitals, shelters, women’s homes, nursing homes, mental health facilities, and rescue services. The foundation is most famous for running the largest fleet of ambulances in Pakistan. All his services were completely free and operated on public donations, which he used with full transparency.</p>

    <h2>Challenges and Discrimination</h2>
    <p>Despite his good work, Edhi faced criticism from extremists for helping babies, women, and people of all religions. He also suffered travel restrictions and was once detained at New York airport. Edhi never took foreign funding or government aid, keeping his work purely public-based and independent. He faced many hardships but remained firm in his belief: "No religion is higher than humanity."</p>

    <h2>Legacy and Death</h2>
    <p>Edhi passed away on July 8, 2016, due to kidney failure. He had donated his eyes, and his funeral was held with full state honors. He was buried at Edhi Village in Karachi. Today, his foundation continues under the leadership of his son Faisal Edhi. His legacy lives on in the millions he served and the inspiration he gave to generations.</p>

    <h2>Famous Quotes</h2>
    <blockquote>
      "No religion is higher than humanity."<br><br>
      "People have become educated, but have not yet become human."<br><br>
      "My ambulance is more Muslim than you."<br><br>
      "Empty words and long praises do not impress God. Show Him your faith by your deeds."
    </blockquote>
