    <p><strong>Major Raja Aziz Bhatti</strong> was a legendary officer in the Pakistan Army, celebrated for his unwavering bravery and patriotism. He laid down his life during the 1965 war with India while defending Lahore against an enemy onslaught, earning the highest military award of Pakistan — the Nishan-e-Haider — for his gallantry and ultimate sacrifice.</p>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Aziz Bhatti was born on August 6, 1928, in British Hong Kong to a Punjabi Rajput family. After the formation of Pakistan in 1947, he and his family migrated to Pakistan. He joined the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul and stood out as an exemplary cadet. His outstanding performance earned him the prestigious Sword of Honour upon graduation — a symbol of his leadership, discipline, and dedication.</p>

    <h2>Military Career</h2>
    <p>Major Raja Aziz Bhatti’s military career was marked by exceptional dedication, discipline, and a natural aptitude for leadership that distinguished him early on. After being commissioned into the prestigious Punjab Regiment of the Pakistan Army, he quickly rose through the ranks, earning the admiration of his seniors and the respect of his peers. His early assignments were a testament to his commitment to military excellence, involving rigorous training exercises, internal security operations, and strategic deployments that prepared him for the complex realities of both peace and potential conflict. Major Bhatti was known not only for his tactical insight but also for his deep sense of responsibility toward his unit and nation. He consistently displayed remarkable initiative, decisiveness under pressure, and a tireless work ethic. Whether operating in training camps or serving on sensitive assignments, he maintained a high standard of conduct and was often looked upon as a role model by younger officers and soldiers alike. His performance reflected not just professional competence but a profound belief in the principles of duty, honor, and service to Pakistan. This solid foundation of experience and character would later serve him and the country in a moment of great historical significance.</p>

    <h2>Battle of Burki & Martyrdom</h2>
    <p>The Battle of Burki during the Indo-Pak war of 1965 became a defining chapter in Major Raja Aziz Bhatti’s life and a moment of eternal pride in Pakistan’s military history. Assigned to defend the strategically vital BRB (Bambanwala-Ravi-Bedian) Canal near Lahore, Major Bhatti commanded a company positioned at the front lines, standing between the enemy and the heart of the city. From September 6 to 12, Indian forces launched relentless attacks using artillery barrages and heavily armored tank units, attempting to break through this critical defense line. Despite being outnumbered and under continuous fire, Major Bhatti’s leadership never wavered. Refusing to be relieved or rest, he chose to remain at his post day and night, encouraging his troops with fearless resolve and unwavering morale. He was often seen moving from trench to trench, directing defenses and rallying his men under the most dangerous conditions, embodying the spirit of selfless command. His strategic acumen and unshakable courage played a crucial role in repelling multiple enemy advances and maintaining control of the canal. On September 12, while observing enemy movements to more effectively guide Pakistani artillery fire, Major Bhatti was struck by a direct hit from enemy shelling. He was martyred mere meters from the frontline, laying down his life while defending his country with unmatched valor. His actions during the Battle of Burki not only saved Lahore from a potential invasion but also earned him the nation’s highest military honor, the Nishan-e-Haider, posthumously. His sacrifice continues to serve as a symbol of patriotism, bravery, and the ultimate devotion to duty.</p>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>Major Raja Aziz Bhatti is a symbol of patriotism and sacrifice in Pakistan. His name evokes pride and reverence across the country. He was posthumously awarded the Nishan-e-Haider, Pakistan’s highest military honor. His bravery is commemorated in school textbooks, military museums, documentaries, and public monuments. His grave in Ladian, Gujrat, is a site of national pilgrimage, and his legacy continues to inspire generations of Pakistanis to serve the country with courage and honor.</p>
    
    <h2> Memorial</h2>
    <p>Maj. Aziz Bhatti was buried in the courtyard of his ancestral home at Ladian, a small village near Gujrat, Punjab in Pakistan.[14] In 1966, the federal government accepted the recommendations and announced to posthumously award the Nishan-e-Haider for his gallantry and actions of valor during the defense of the Burki.</p>

    <h2>Memorial at Barki</h2>
<p>Major Raja Aziz Bhatti, known as "Muhafiz-e-Lahore (Defender of Lahore)," received Pakistan’s highest award for his valor. He was born in Hong Kong in a Muslim Rajput family originally from Lahore in 1928. He was commissioned into the Pakistan Army in 1950 (17 Punjab Regiment). Major Aziz Bhatti was posted to the Barki sector in Lahore during the Indo-Pak war of 1965. Being a Company Commander, he moved his platoon forward to the bank of the BRB Canal under constant fire from enemy tanks and artillery. He resisted the enemy for five days and nights while defending this Pakistani outpost on the strategic BRB Canal without rest.</p>

<p>On 6 September 1965, he left his company headquarters and moved to his forward platoon, staying with them under incessant artillery and tank attacks. He positioned himself at an elevated point to observe every move of the enemy. This point was vulnerable to enemy tank and artillery fire. After five days of continuous fighting on the front, he was offered relief for rest, but he refused and said, "I do not want to go back; I will shed the last drop of my blood in the defense of my dear homeland."</p>

<p>On 10 September 1965, Major Aziz Bhatti was hit in the chest by an enemy tank shell while observing enemy movement from this elevated position. He was awarded the highest gallantry award — the Nishan-e-Haider — in recognition of his supreme act of bravery.</p>


<h2> Education</h2>
<p> Aziz Bhatti was educated in Hong Kong where he completed his matriculation and attended the Queen's College but his education was halted due to the Japanese invasion and occupation of Hong Kong in 1941. He was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1944, first serving at the rank of the seaman recruit and as the tower watchman (observation post) before being directed to attend the officer school offered by the Imperial Japanese Navy due to his educational qualifications</p>
