      <p>
        <strong>Dr.Abdul Qadeer Khan</strong> title can be described as the
        "Father of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program". He is also recognized
        for his contributions to nuclear technology and is considered a national
        hero in Pakistan. He was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz, Pakistan's highest
        civilian honor, twice.
      </p>

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan was born on April 1, 1936, in Bhopal, India. He
        was a Muhajir of Pashtun origin. His family later moved to Pakistan in
        1952. Khan's early education included studies in Europe, where he earned
        a Ph.D. in metallurgical engineering from the Catholic University of
        Leuven. He also received a master's degree from Delft University of
        Technology. His career led him to work in the Netherlands, where he
        later became involved in Pakistan's nuclear program.
      </p>

      <h2>Political Career</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan briefly entered the political arena by founding
        the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz-e-Pakistan (Movement for the Protection of
        Pakistan) in 2012. The party was dissolved a year later after failing to
        win any seats in the 2013 general election. He was known for his
        scientific achievements and advocacy for nuclear technology sharing,
        which led to a controversial political career.
        <br />
        Elaboration:
        <br />
        <strong>Tehreek-e-Tahafuz-e-Pakistan</strong>
        In 2012, Dr. Khan established the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz-e-Pakistan (TTP)
        with the hope of using his popularity to gain political traction. The
        party's aim was to protect Pakistan, but it was dissolved in 2013 after
        failing to secure any parliamentary seats.
        <br />
        <strong>Political Advocacy</strong>
        Dr. Khan was known for his strong views on nuclear technology sharing
        and his advocacy for a scientific education.
        <br />
        <strong>Controversy and Support </strong>
        He became a controversial figure due to his alleged involvement in the
        proliferation of nuclear technology, but he maintained considerable
        support within Pakistan, with many institutions and schools named in his
        honor.
        <br />
        <strong>Advisory Role</strong>
        Following his departure from the Khan Research Laboratories, Dr. Khan
        briefly served as a policy advisor on science and technology to the
        Musharraf administration.

      <h2>
        Dr.Abdul Qadeer Khan Research Laboratories and atomic bomb program
      </h2>
      <p>
        In April 1976, Khan joined the atomic bomb program and became part of
        the enrichment division, initially collaborating with Khalil
        Qureshi.Calculations performed by him were valuable contributions to
        centrifuges and a vital link to nuclear weapon research, but continue to
        push for his ideas for feasibility of weapon-grade uranium even though
        it had a low priority, with most efforts still aimed to produce
        military-grade plutonium.Because of his interest in uranium metallurgy
        and his frustration at having been passed over for director of the
        uranium division (the job was instead given to Bashiruddin Mahmood),
        Khan refused to engage in further calculations and caused tensions with
        other researchers.Khan became highly unsatisfied and bored with the
        research led by Mahmood. finally, he submitted a critical report to
        Bhutto, in which he explained that the "enrichment program" was nowhere
        near success. Khan initially worked with the Pakistan Atomic Energy
        Commission (PAEC), but differences arose with its head, Munir Ahmad
        Khan. In mid-1976, at Bhutto’s direction, Khan founded the Engineering
        Research Laboratory, or ERL, for the purpose of developing a
        uranium-enrichment capability. (In May 1981 the laboratory was renamed
        the Khan Research Laboratory, or KRL.) Khan’s base of operations was in
        Kahuta, 50 km (30 miles) southeast of Islamabad; there Khan developed
        prototype centrifuges based on German designs and used his suppliers
        list to import essential components from Swiss, Dutch, British, and
        German companies, among others.<br />
        In the early 1980s Pakistan acquired from China the blueprints of a
        nuclear weapon that used a uranium implosion design that the Chinese had
        successfully tested in 1966. It is generally believed that the Chinese
        tested a derivative design for the Pakistanis on May 26, 1990. Khan,
        having satisfied Pakistan’s needs for its own uranium weapon, began in
        the mid-1980s to create front companies in Dubayy, Malaysia, and
        elsewhere, and through these entities he covertly sold or traded
        centrifuges, components, designs, and expertise in an extensive
        black-market network. The customers included Iran, which went on to
        build a uranium-enrichment complex based on the Pakistani model. Khan
        visited North Korea at least 13 times and is suspected of having
        transferred enrichment technology to that country. (His laboratory also
        developed Pakistan’s Ghauri ballistic missile with help from the North
        Koreans.) Libya, supplied by Khan, embarked upon a nuclear weapons
        program until it was interrupted by the United States in 2003
        <br />

        On January 31, 2004, Khan was arrested for transferring nuclear
        technology to other countries. On February 4 he read a statement on
        Pakistani television taking full responsibility for his operations and
        absolving the military and government of any involvement—a claim that
        many nuclear experts found difficult to believe. The next day he was
        pardoned by Pakistan’s president, Pervez Musharraf, but he was held
        under house arrest until 2009. Khan’s critics, particularly in the West,
        expressed dismay at such lenient treatment of a man whom one observer
        called “the greatest nuclear proliferator of all time.” For many
        Pakistanis, however, Khan remains a symbol of pride, a hero whose
        contribution strengthened Pakistan’s national security against India.

      <h2>Youm-e-Takbir</h2>
      <p>
        Youm-e-Takbir(The day of greatness) is celebrated as a national day in
        Pakistan on 28 May in commemoration of Chagai-I and Chagai-II series of
        nuclear tests. The nuclear tests made Pakistan the seventh nation to
        possess nuclear weapons and the first in the Muslim world.The Prime
        Minister of Pakistan at the time, Mian Nawaz Sharif and by the joint
        efforts of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan ordered the launching of the nuclear
        bomb test in response to Indian threats and nuclear tests.Youm-e-Takbeer
        (Day of Greatness) is celebrated in Pakistan on May 28th to commemorate
        the nuclear tests conducted on that day in 1998, making Pakistan the
        seventh nuclear power in the world and the first Muslim nation with a
        nuclear arsenal. It's a day to recognize Pakistan's defense capabilities
        and the collective effort that contributed to this achievement.
        <br />
        Thousands of names were propose by millions of Pakistanis. This name was
        suggested by more than one person. All the people who suggested this
        name were given the Prime Minister Award. Youm-e-Takbir here can be
        translated to "The day of greatness" or "The day of God's greatness".

      <h2>Dr.Abdul Qadeer Khan Last Days</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, known as the "father of Pakistan's nuclear
        program," passed away on October 10, 2021, in Islamabad at the age of
        85. He was given a state funeral and buried in the H-8 graveyard. He
        reportedly passed away after being hospitalized with lung problems.
        Dawn.com reports that he was admitted to a hospital where his health
        deteriorated early morning and he died after being transferred. Radio
        Pakistan reports that he was admitted to a local hospital with lung
        problem He was given a state funeral at the Faisal Mosque before being
        buried at the H-8 graveyard in Islamabad.

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. Abdul Qadeer khan's legacy is complex and highly debated. While he's
        often considered the "father of Pakistan's nuclear program," he's also a
        controversial figure due to his involvement in nuclear proliferation,
        according to The Guardian. He played a key role in establishing
        Pakistan's nuclear program by obtaining blueprints for uranium
        centrifuges. However, his work also led to the development and
        proliferation of nuclear technology to other countries, according to the
        Royal United Services Institute.

        <strong>Controversial Figure </strong>
        <br />
        <strong>Nuclear Proliferation </strong>
        Khan is known for his role in exporting nuclear technology, particularly
        centrifuges, to countries like North Korea, Iran, and Libya. This led to
        concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
        <br />
        <strong> Opportunist </strong>
        Some view Khan as a self-serving individual who exploited his position
        to gain wealth and power.
        <br />
        <strong> Nation Hero </strong>
        Others see him as a national hero who secured Pakistan's nuclear
        independence.
        <br />
        <strong> Positive Contributions </strong>
        <br />
        <strong> Pakistan's Nuclear Program </strong>
        Khan's work was crucial in establishing Pakistan's nuclear program and
        developing its nuclear capabilities.
        <br />
        <strong> Uranium Enrichment </strong>
        He was instrumental in developing Pakistan's uranium enrichment
        technology, allowing the country to produce weapons-grade fuel.
        <br />
        <strong> Deterrent </strong>
        Khan argued that nuclear weapons were essential for Pakistan's security
        and deterrence.
        <br />
        <strong> Negative Aspects </strong>
        <br />
        <strong> Proliferation </strong>
        His actions contributed to the spread of nuclear technology, raising
        concerns about nuclear proliferation.
        <br />
        <strong> International Sanctions </strong>
        His involvement in nuclear proliferation led to international sanctions
        against Pakistan.
        <br />
        <strong> Unethical Practices </strong>
        Some accuse him of using his position for personal gain and violating
        ethical standards.
        <br />
        <strong>In Summary </strong> Dr. A.Q. Khan's legacy is a complex mix of
        positive and negative aspects. While he played a pivotal role in
        Pakistan's nuclear program, his involvement in nuclear proliferation and
        controversial practices have left a lasting and contentious mark on his
        reputation

      <h2>Famous Quotes</h2>
      <blockquote>
        "I saved the country" and "If we had had nuclear capability before 1971,
        we would not have lost half of our country—present-day Bangladesh—after
        disgraceful defeat"
      </blockquote>
