      <p>
        <strong>Dr.Abdus Salam</strong> title can be described as a Pakistani
        theoretical physicist. He shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics with
        Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg for his contribution to the
        electroweak unification theory.[8] He was the first Pakistani and the
        first scientist from an Islamic country to receive a Nobel Prize and the
        second from an Islamic country to receive any Nobel Prize, after Anwar
        Sadat of Egypt.
      </p>

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Abdus Salam's early life was characterized by a strong emphasis on
        education and a remarkable academic aptitude. Born in Jhang, Punjab, on
        January 29, 1926, he excelled in his studies from a young age. He showed
        a strong affinity for mathematics and science, particularly physics. His
        father, a government official in the Department of Education, played a
        crucial role in instilling the importance of education in Salam's
        upbringing.
      </p>

      <h2>Scientific Career</h2>
      <p>
        Early in his career, Salam made an important and significant
        contribution in quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory,
        including its extension into particle and nuclear physics. In his early
        career in Pakistan, Salam was greatly interested in mathematical series
        and their relation to physics. Salam had played an influential role in
        the advancement of nuclear physics, but he maintained and dedicated
        himself to mathematics and theoretical physics and focused Pakistan to
        do more research in theoretical physics.[31] However, he regarded
        nuclear physics (nuclear fission and nuclear power) as a non-pioneering
        part of physics as it had already "happened". Even in Pakistan, Salam
        was the leading driving force in theoretical physics, with many
        scientists he continued to influence and encourage to keep their work on
        theoretical physics.
        <br />Salam had a prolific research career in theoretical and
        high-energy physics. Salam had worked on theory of the neutrino . an
        elusive particle that was first postulated by Wolfgang Pauli in the
        1930s. Salam introduced chiral symmetry in the theory of neutrinos.
        Salam introduced the massive Higgs bosons to the theory of the Standard
        Model, where he later predicted the existence of proton decay. In 1963,
        Salam published his theoretical work on the vector meson. The paper
        introduced the interaction of vector meson, photon (vector
        electrodynamics), and the renormalisation of vector mesons' known mass
        after the interaction.In 1961, Salam began to work with John Clive Ward
        on symmetries and electroweak unification. In 1964, Salam and Ward
        worked on a Gauge theory for the weak and electromagnetic interaction,
        subsequently obtaining model. Salam was convinced that all the
        elementary particle interactions are actually the gauge interactions In
        1968, together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam formulated the
        mathematical concept of their work. While in Imperial College, Salam,
        along with Glashow and Jeffrey Goldstone, mathematically proved the
        Goldstone's theorem, that a massless spin-zero object must appear in a
        theory as a result of spontaneous breaking of a continuous global
        symmetry.In 1967-8, Salam and Weinberg incorporated the Higgs mechanism
        into Glashow's discovery, giving it a modern form in electroweak theory,
        and thus theorised half of the Standard Model.In 1968, together with
        Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam finally formulated the mathematical
        concept of their work. <br />In 1966, Salam carried out pioneering work
        on a hypothetical particle. Salam showed the possible electromagnetic
        interaction between the Magnetic monopole and the C-violation, thus he
        formulated the magnetic photon. Following the publication of PRL
        Symmetry Breaking papers in 1964, Steven Weinberg and Salam were the
        first to apply the Higgs mechanism to electroweak symmetry breaking.
        Salam provided a mathematical postulation for the interaction between
        the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry theory. In 1972, Salam
        began to work with Indian-American theoretical physicist Jogesh Pati.
        Pati wrote to Salam several times expressing interest to work under
        Salam's direction, in response to which Salam eventually invited Pati to
        the ICTP seminar in Pakistan. <br />Physicists had believed that there
        were four fundamental forces of nature: the gravitational force, the
        strong and weak nuclear forces, and the electromagnetic force. Salam had
        worked on the unification of these forces from 1959 with Glashow and
        Weinberg. While at Imperial College London, Salam successfully showed
        that weak nuclear forces are not really different from electromagnetic
        forces, and two could inter-convert. Salam provided a theory that shows
        the unification of two fundamental forces of nature, weak nuclear forces
        and the electromagnetic forces, one into another.[51] Glashow had also
        formulated the same work, and the theory was combined in 1966. In 1967,
        Salam proved the electroweak unification theory mathematically, and
        finally published the papers. For this achievement, Salam, Glashow, and
        Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979.

      <h2>Dr.Abdus Salam Space Program</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan was among the first 10 countries to start a space programme.
        Its space programme started upon the appointment of Dr. Abdus Salam
        (Noble Prize Winner) as the Chairman of the Space Upper Atmosphere
        Research Commission (SUPARCO) in 1961. Salam approached President Khan
        to lay the foundations of Pakistan's first executive agency to
        co-ordinate space research.By executive order on 16 September 1961 the
        Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) was established
        with Salam founding director.Salam immediately travelled to the United
        States, where he signed a space co-operation agreement with the US
        Government. In November 1961, NASA built the Flight Test Center in
        Balochistan Province. During this time, Salam visited the Pakistan Air
        Force Academy where he met with Air Commodore (Brigadier-General)
        Wladyslaw Turowicz,a Polish military scientist and an aerospace
        engineer. Turowicz was made the first technical director of the space
        centre, and a programme of rocket testing ensued. In 1964, while in the
        US Salam visited the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and met with nuclear
        engineers Salim Mehmud and Tariq Mustafa. Salam signed another agreement
        with the NASA which launched a programme to provide training to
        Pakistan's scientists and engineers.Both nuclear engineers returned to
        Pakistan and were inducted into SUPARCO.
        <br />
      </p>

      <h2>Nuclear weapons programme</h2>
      <p>
        Salam knew the importance of nuclear technology in Pakistan, for
        civilian and peaceful purposes. But, according to his biographers, Salam
        played an ambiguous role in Pakistan's own atomic bomb project. As late
        as the 1960s, Salam made an unsuccessful proposal for the establishment
        of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, but it was deferred on economic
        grounds by Ayub Khan. According to Rehman, Salam's influence in nuclear
        development was diminished as late as 1974, and he became critical of
        Bhutto's control over science. But Salam personally did not terminate
        his connection with the scientists working in the theoretical physics
        division at PAEC.As early as 1972–73, he had been a great advocate for
        the atomic bomb project, but subsequently took a stance against it after
        he fell out with Bhutto over the Second Amendment to the Constitution of
        Pakistan which declared the Ahmaddiya denomination to be non-Islamic. In
        1965, Salam led the establishing of the nuclear research institute
        ,PINSTECH.In 1965, the plutonium Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor
        (PARR-I) went critical under Salams' leadership.In 1973, Salam proposed
        the idea of establishing an annual college to promote scientific
        activities in the country to the Chairman of PAEC, Munir Khan, who
        accepted and fully supported the idea. This led to the establishment of
        the International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary
        Needs (INSC)

        <br />
        On 20 January 1972, Salam, as Science Advisor to the President of
        Pakistan, managed and participated in a secret meeting of nuclear
        scientists with former Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in Multan,
        known as the 'Multan Meeting'. At this meeting Bhutto orchestrated the
        development of a deterrence programme. Salam and appointed Munir Khan as
        Chairman of PAEC, and head of the atomic bomb program, as Salam had
        supported Khan. A few months after the meeting, Salam, Khan, and
        Riazuddin, met with Bhutto in his residence where the scientists briefed
        him about the nuclear weapons program. Salam immediately started to
        motivate and invite scientists to begin work with PAEC in the
        development of fission weapons.
        <br />

        In March 1974, Salam and Khan also established the Wah Group Scientist
        that was charged with manufacturing materials, explosive lenses and
        triggering mechanism development of the weapon. Salam remained
        associated with the nuclear weapons programme until mid-1974, when he
        left the country after Ahmadi were declared non-Muslims by the Pakistani
        Parliament. In spite of this, Salam maintained close relations with the
        theoretical physics division at PAEC who kept him informed about the
        status of the calculations needed to calculate the performance of the
        atomic bomb, according to Norman Dombey.
      </p>

      <h2>Death</h2>
      <p>
        Abdus Salam died on 21 November 1996 at the age of 70 in Oxford,
        England, from progressive supranuclear palsy. His body was returned to
        Pakistan and kept in Darul Ziafat, where some 13,000 men and women
        visited to pay their last respects. Approximately 30,000 people attended
        his funeral prayers.Salam was buried in Bahishti Maqbara, a cemetery
        established by the Ahmadiyya Community at Rabwah, Punjab, Pakistan, next
        to his parents' graves.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Salam's work in Pakistan has been far reaching and regarded as highly
        influential. He is remembered by his peers and students as the "father
        of Pakistan's school of Theoretical Physics" as well as Pakistan's
        science. Salam was a charismatic and iconic figure, a symbol among them
        of what they were working or researching toward in their fields.He is
        best known for his work on electroweak theory, which helped unify the
        electromagnetic and weak forces, and for his founding of the
        International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy.

        <br />
        <strong>Nobel Prize in Physics (1979) </strong>

        Salam shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Steven Weinberg and Sheldon
        Glashow for their work on electroweak unification, which predicted the
        existence of certain fundamental particles.
        <br />
        However, Salam's legacy is often ignored in the Pakistani education
        system despite his achievements. According to the documentary 'Salam:
        The First Nobel Laureate,' very few young Pakistanis have heard of him,
        and his name is not mentioned in Pakistani school textbooks.In 2020, a
        group of students belonging to the State Youth Parliament desecrated an
        image of Salam that was present at a college in Gujranwala, while
        chanting slogans against the Ahmadiyya community. This deliberate effort
        to stifle mention of Salam is attributed to Salam belonging to the
        Ahmadiyya Muslim community, who have faced state-sponsored
        discrimination since the 1970s.
