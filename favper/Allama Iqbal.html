    <p><strong>Allama Muhammad Iqbal</strong> (9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938) was a renowned poet, philosopher, and politician in British India. Regarded as Mufakkir-e-Pakistan (The Thinker of Pakistan), Shair-e-Mashriq (The Poet of the East), and Hakeem-ul-Ummat (The Sage of the Ummah), he played a vital role in inspiring the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent towards a separate nation, which ultimately led to the creation of Pakistan.</p>

    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>Born in Sialkot, Punjab, Iqbal belonged to a Kashmiri Brahmin family that had converted to Islam. He received his early education in traditional Islamic studies, later moving to Lahore where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree. He went on to study in Europe, earning a philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge and a doctorate from the University of Munich. His thesis was titled "The Development of Metaphysics in Persia."</p>

    <h2>Philosophical and Literary Contributions</h2>
    <p>Iqbal’s poetry is known for its powerful messages on self-realization, Islamic revivalism, and unity. His works in Persian and Urdu include "Asrar-e-Khudi", "Rumuz-i-Bekhudi", "Bang-e-Dra", and "Payam-e-Mashriq". He emphasized the concept of "Khudi" (selfhood), encouraging Muslims to awaken and realize their spiritual and intellectual potential. Iqbal's poetry stirred millions and revived a sense of pride and purpose among Muslims of the subcontinent.</p>

    <h2>Political Thought and the Idea of Pakistan</h2>
    <p>Iqbal was a prominent member of the All-India Muslim League and delivered several influential speeches. In his 1930 address in Allahabad, he envisioned a separate homeland for Muslims in the northwest of India. Though he passed away before the creation of Pakistan, his vision laid the ideological foundation for the new state. His ideas influenced Muhammad Ali Jinnah and others who carried forward the Pakistan Movement.</p>

    <h2>Relationship with the Muslim World</h2>
    <p>Iqbal had deep ties with the wider Muslim world. He wrote extensively about issues faced by Muslims globally and called for unity and revival. His admiration for Islamic history and thought can be seen in his poetry, where he references figures such as Rumi, Ghazali, and Syed Jamaluddin Afghani.</p>

    <h2>Death and Legacy</h2>
    <p>Allama Iqbal died on April 21, 1938, in Lahore. He is buried near the Badshahi Mosque, and his tomb is visited by millions. Iqbal Day is celebrated every year on November 9 in Pakistan. His contributions to literature, philosophy, and the idea of Pakistan have earned him a permanent place in the history of the Muslim world.</p>

    <h2>Famous Quotes</h2>
    <blockquote>
      "Khudi ko kar buland itna ke har taqdeer se pehle,<br>
      Khuda bande se khud pooche, bata teri raza kya hai."<br><br>
      "Nations are born in the hearts of poets, they prosper and die in the hands of politicians."<br><br>
      "People who have no hold over their process of thinking are likely to be ruined by liberty of thought."<br><br>
      "Words, without power, is mere philosophy."
