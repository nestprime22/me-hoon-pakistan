      <p>
        <strong><h2>Cold Start (Military Doctrine)</h2></strong> Cold Start is a
        military doctrine that was developed by the Indian Armed Forces for use
        in a possible war with Pakistan.It involves the various branches of
        India's military conducting offensive operations as part of unified
        battlegroups. The doctrine is intended to allow India's conventional
        forces to perform holding attacks to prevent a nuclear retaliation from
        Pakistan in case of a conflict.The first Integrated Battle Group has
        been structured as of August 2019.
      </p>

      <h1>Origins</h1>
      <p>
        India's defence strategy from 1974 was, in the words of former Defence
        Minister George Fernandes, "a non-aggressive, non-provocative defense
        policy",centred on "holding corps" to halt hostile advances. In response
        to the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001, India
        initiated a full mobilisation. Taking almost a month, the slow
        mobilisation demonstrated the weakness of India's policy. The long
        mobilisation time resulted in sufficient international pressure to
        prevent India from conducting a retaliatory strike.
      </p>

      <h2>Sundarji Doctrine (1981–2004)</h2>
      <p>
        The Sundarji Doctrine was made up of seven defensive "holding corps" of
        the Indian Army and deployed near the Pakistani border. Possessing
        limited offensive power, the holding corps' primary responsibility was
        to check a Pakistani advance.India's offensive potency was derived from
        the "strike corps", which were made up of a mechanised infantry and
        extensive artillery support. "Unlike the holding corps that was deployed
        close to the border", argues Walter Ladwig of the University of Oxford,
        "the strike corps was based in central India, a significant distance
        from the international border. In a war, after the holding corps halted
        a Pakistani attack, the strike corps would counterattack, penetrating
        deep into Pakistani territory to destroy the Pakistan Army's own strike
        corps through 'deep sledgehammer blows' in a high-intensity battle of
        attrition".<br />
        However, the limitation of the Sundarji doctrine was exposed on 13
        December 2001, when five Pakistani terrorists attacked the Indian
        Parliament. Twelve people, including the five gunmen, were killed and 22
        were injured. India suspected Pakistan-based militant groups were behind
        the attack because just two months earlier, a similar assault had been
        carried out by the Jaish-e-Mohammad on the Kashmir State Assembly. India
        received credible evidence that militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and
        Jaish-e-Mohammad were behind the attack, prompting India to initiate
        Operation Parakram, the largest activation of its forces since the 1971
        Bangladesh Liberation War.<br />
        It took the Indian strike corps three weeks to get to the international
        border. During that time, Pakistan was able to counter-mobilise and
        allow for intervening powers, the United States in particular, to become
        intermediaries to the conflict. Urging India to restrain, the American
        Ambassador to India, Robert Blackwill, demanded for India to wait until
        President Pervez Musharraf delivered a speech that would address the
        crisis. Musharraf's speech was quick to denounce terrorism generally,
        specifically militant groups operating in Kashmir, and promised a
        crackdown. "As a result of Musharraf's declaration, by the time the
        [Indian] strike corps reached the border region, India's political
        justification for military action had been significantly reduced,"
        Walter C. Ladwig maintained.<br />
        Indian military strategists came to the conclusion that the Sundarji
        Doctrine was flawed. It was too inflexible to respond to terrorist
        attacks or other indirect challenges for three reasons: <br /><br />
        * "The strike corps was too big and too far away from the international
        border, making it difficult to deploy in a timely fashion".<br />
        * "The long duration needed to mobilise the strike corps prevented
        strategic surprise, allowing Pakistan plenty of time to
        counter-"mobilise".<br />
        * "The holding corps' lack of offensive power along the international
        border prevented it from engaging in significant offensives".
      </p>

      <h1>Doctrine Development</h1>
      <p>
        The development of the doctrine represented a significant change in
        Indian defence planning. Exercises aimed at reducing mobilisation time
        and improved network-centric warfare capabilities have contributed to
        the development of the doctrine. Despite its advances, the doctrine
        remains in the experimental stage.<br /><br />
        Drawing on the experience of the 1967 Six-Day War as well as the
        Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Indian defence planners envisioned a new
        doctrine that would involve limited, rapid armoured thrusts, with
        infantry and necessary air support.<br /><br />
        As per Cold Start promulgation, offensive operations could begin within
        48 hours after orders had been issued. Such a limited response time
        would enable Indian forces to surprise their Pakistani counterparts.
        Operations would involve armoured spearheads, launched from forward
        positions in Punjab and Rajasthan.<br /><br />
        The plan emphasises speed and overwhelming firepower: armored formations
        and accompanying infantry would advance into eastern Pakistan, with
        limited goals in terms of distance and in terms of duration. The plan
        reportedly has a significant air support component. From the Indian
        perspective, the plan has the added virtue of accentuating Pakistani
        discomfiture and angst, which theoretically has some deterrent value.
      </p>

      <h1>India's Stance</h1>
      <p>
        India denies the Cold Start strategy. Quoting the Indian Army chief:
        "There is nothing called 'Cold Start'. As part of our overall strategy
        we have a number of contingencies and options, depending on what the
        aggressor does. In the recent years, we have been improving our systems
        with respect to mobilization, but our basic military posture is
        defensive".<br /><br />
        In January 2011, while speaking to the media in the run-up to Army Day,
        Army chief General VK Singh came closer than any other government
        official in describing the widely speculated Indian war doctrine,
        popularly referred to as Cold Start: "There is nothing like Cold Start.
        But we have a 'proactive strategy' which takes steps in a proactive
        manner so that we can achieve what our doctrines and strategies".<br /><br />
        Former Indian Defence Minister Jaswant Singh has denied the existence of
        the doctrine: "There is no Cold Start doctrine. No such thing. It was an
        off-the-cuff remark from a former chief of staff. I have been defense
        minister of the country. I should know".<br /><br />
        Despite such assertions, in recent years, the Indian Army has conducted
        a series of major combat exercises, including the 2018 'Brahmashira'
        exercise by the 2 'Kharga' Strike Corps in Rajasthan,to practice "swift
        multiple offensives deep into enemy territory" under its "Pro-Active
        Conventional War Strategy".<br /><br />
        On 6 January 2017, Army Chief General Bipin Rawat acknowledged the
        existence of this doctrine.
      </p>

      <h1>Pakistan's Response</h1>
      <p>
        The Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of the Pakistani military
        declared 2010 the "Year of Training" and conducted a large-scale
        joint-military exercise, Azm-e-Nau–III, which focused on offensive
        defence against Cold Start. The military also tested the Nasr,a
        nuclear-capable tactical ballistic missile from the family of Hatf-IX
        missiles with a purported range of 60 km, a high accuracy and a
        shoot-and-scoot delivery system. The Institute for Defence Studies and
        Analyses stated that the development of the Nasr indicates that Pakistan
        views Cold Start with concern and that the missile was meant to deter
        India's implementation of the doctrine. It added that the net result
        would be "further nuclear impact(s) on India's territory".
      </p>
      <h1>Validation</h1>
      <p>
        In May 2011, India launched Operation Vijayee Bhava ("Be Victorious"), a
        defence exercise involving 50,000 troops in Bikaner and Suratgarh near
        the border with Pakistan to boost the synergy between the various
        branches of the armed forces.<br /><br />
        The main objective of the operation was to cut down the mobilisation
        time of the military, which took 27 days to mobilise during Operation
        Parakram. The Indian Army confirmed that the exercise was successful by
        reducing mobilisation time drastically to 48 hours.<br /><br />
        In July 2011, India tested the Prahaar, a new solid-fuel tactical
        ballistic missile with a range of 150 km designed to provide invading
        Indian Army battle groups with lethal fire support.<br /><br />
        Later that year, the Indian Army conducted its largest war games in the
        last two decades, Operation Sudarshan Shakti, under the Southern Command
        Headquarters, to revalidate its Cold Start doctrine.The desert exercise
        was based on the Integrated Theatre Battle concept, with various defence
        wings and military elements being required to participating in a single
        cohesive format during war.<br /><br />
        The focus of Sudarshan Shakti was to practice synergy and integration
        between ground and air forces. Nearly 60,000 troops and 500 armoured
        vehicles, including T-72, T-90 and Arjun main battle tanks, carried out
        simulated assaults on their objectives, with support from artillery and
        the Indian Air Force.<br /><br />
        The Indian military has also tested newly inducted radars, unmanned
        aerial vehicles, surveillance systems, precision guided bombs, missiles,
        space-based assets and real-time data-sharing between elements.
      </p>
      <h1>Criticism</h1>
      <p>
        The Cold Start doctrine has invited criticism from Pakistani media and
        former generals.They claim that although the doctrine was designed to
        punish Pakistan in a limited manner without triggering nuclear
        retaliation, the Indian Army cannot be sure if Pakistan's leadership
        will actually refrain from such a response.<br /><br />
        Criticism of the doctrine by Timothy J. Roemer, US Ambassador to India
        from 2009 to 2011, was revealed in a leaked cable.Roemer gave a detailed
        explanation of the doctrine as well as several facts that he believed
        raised questions about the actual application of doctrine. He raised
        questions about India's willingness to pursue the option, including the
        decision not to implement the doctrine after the deadly 2008 Mumbai
        attacks. Some of the claims that he made were that India would likely
        encounter "mixed results",[30] that Cold Start is "a mixture of myth and
        reality" and that "the value of the doctrine to the GOI (Government of
        India) may lie more in the plan’s existence than in any real world
        application".<br /><br />
        Walter Ladwig has suggested that a host of factors, including the
        terrain, the favorable deployment of Pakistani forces, and a lack of
        strategic surprise in the most likely conflict scenarios, would mitigate
        whatever mobilization advantages India may be gaining by its
        experimentation with Cold Start.
      </p>
      <h1>2008 Mumbai Terrorist Attacks</h1>
      <p>
        By intelligence intercepts and analysis carried out during the 2008
        Mumbai attacks, Indian planners had assessed that the ongoing attack was
        likely a deliberate attempt by the terrorist organisation
        Lashkar-e-Taiba to provoke an Indian military strike on Pakistan, the
        objective being to entice other Islamist Pakistani militant groups that
        were engaged in armed conflict with the Pakistani state to redirect
        their attacks away from the Pakistani state and instead unify against an
        external threat, India.Consequently, to defeat the strategic goals of
        the Pakistani planners of the Mumbai massacre, India decided to hold off
        launching a punitive military strike on Pakistan.That assessment was
        later verified by interrogations and court testimony of one of the
        planners of the massacre, David Headley (half-Pakistani, half-American),
        while he was in custody of US and Indian authorities.
      </p>
      <h1>Impact</h1>
      <p>
        In a manner similar to the way that the US Strategic Defense Initiative
        impacted the economy of the Soviet Union during the Cold War,the threat
        of the Cold Start doctrine and the increase in the Indian defence budget
        from $24 billion to $40 billion between 2007 and 2009 both apparently
        prompted the Pakistan government to increase its defence budget sharply
        to 32% of their federal government's net revenue receipts, further
        increasing the strain on that country's already-tenuous economy.In 2009,
        financial constraints on budget and the effects on national economy made
        the Pakistani government officials to begin working on the database
        program that it called "Threat Matrix", which was revealed in 2013
        during a press conference.
