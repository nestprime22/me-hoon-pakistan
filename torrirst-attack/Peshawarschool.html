        <strong>Army Public School attack Peshawar 2014 </strong> title can be
        described as a (APS) attack in Peshawar, Pakistan, on December 16, 2014,
        was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the country’s history.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peshawar school massacre, terrorist attack in which seven heavily armed
        Taliban fighters stormed an army-run primary and secondary school in
        Peshawar, Pakistan, on December 16, 2014, killing 150 people, of whom at
        least 134 were students. At the time of the incident, the Army Public
        School held more than 1,000 staff members and students; many of the
        pupils were children of military personnel. The terrorists began their
        attack in mid-morning when they accessed the large compound by scaling a
        wall. According to some reports, they bombed their own vehicle to create
        a distraction for school guards. Entering the main assembly hall, where
        a large group of students was taking a lesson in first aid, they
        proceeded to shoot indiscriminately. The attackers, who were armed with
        grenades and automatic rifles, then went to the classrooms, where they
        concentrated their fire on teachers and older children. According to
        official sources, they sought only to kill and made no attempt to take
        hostages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Commandos from the Special Services Group of the Pakistani army arrived
        at some point and at length succeeded in cornering the attackers, all of
        whom were wearing suicide vests lined with explosives. The attackers
        died in the confrontation, and some of the soldiers were injured by
        shrapnel from the vests. The attack was estimated to have lasted about
        eight hours. Even as it continued, alarmed parents gathered at the gates
        of the school compound. According to various reports, 150 people were
        killed by the gunmen, and more than 100 were injured. Responsibility for
        the massacre was claimed by Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the
        Pakistani branch of the Taliban, a militant Islamic movement. TTP
        leaders sought to justify the massacre as retribution for violent
        government attacks on its members. In the view of knowledgeable
        observers, the most probable provocation was Operation Zarb-e-Azb, a
        government anti-militant offensive in North Waziristan, one of
        Pakistan’s tribal regions. The massacre aroused worldwide condemnation.
        In response, Pakistan reinstated the death penalty after a six-year
        moratorium and executed many suspected Taliban militants.
      </p>
      <h2>Attack</h2>
      <p>
        Army Public School is located at Warsak Road near the Peshawar Cantt,
        and is a part of Army Public Schools and College Systems that runs 146
        schools across Pakistan.On the day of the attack, a total of 1,099
        students and staff were registered in the school.The attack began at
        around 10:30 a.m., when seven gunmen wearing explosive belts entered the
        school after having scaled the walls.Before entering the school, the
        gunmen set fire to the Suzuki Bolan ST41 van in which they had arrived.
        The terrorists, bearing automatic weapons and grenades, moved straight
        toward the auditorium located at the centre of the complex and opened
        fire indiscriminately on the children who were gathered there for an
        assembly on first aid training.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations
        (ISPR) and public relations department of the Pakistani military,
        Major-General Asim Bajwa, the terrorists did not intend to take any
        hostages but instead wanted to kill as many people as they could. As the
        terrorists opened fire, many of the people ran toward the two exits on
        the other side of the auditorium; many others were gunned down in the
        garden. Reports also surfaced that pupils were forced to watch teachers
        be killed in front of them. This included principal Tahira Qazi, who was
        burned to death in front of her students. Within 15 minutes, the SSG
        teams had stormed the school and entered the premises from two sides in
        their heavy armoured vehicles and trucks. Immediately, the SSG personnel
        engaged the terrorists, preventing them from going after and killing
        other remaining teaching staff and students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the SSG commandos had reached the area and surrounded the
        administration block. Most of the operation took place in the attempt to
        clear this block and rescue the hostages taken by the gunmen. Special
        teams of snipers and their spotters pinpointed the terrorists. One of
        the six attackers was killed by the snipers from the windows and air
        vents, while the other three were killed when the commandos stormed the
        building and rescued the remaining hostages in the process. Seven
        commandos, including two officers, were injured in the battle. A search
        and clearance operation was started immediately to defuse any IEDs
        planted by the gunmen within the school premises or in the suicide vests
        that the terrorists were wearing. The terrorists were in contact with
        their handlers during the attack, but soon after the SSG had moved in,
        the security forces intercepted the terrorists' communications.
      </p>

      <h2>Victims</h2>
      <p>
        An estimated total of 1,099 people and teaching staff were present on
        the school premises. Responding forces were successful in rescuing
        approximately 960, though 139 were injured. 149 people were killed,
        including 132 children and 9 school staff members.[24] The provincial
        Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa announced PKR 3,164,000 (US$11,300
        approx.) as compensation to the kin of each of the deceased in the
        terror attack and PKR 200,000 (US$1,130 approx.) to the seriously
        injured.
      </p>

      <h2>Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the
        attack, describing it as revenge for Operation Zarb-e-Azb, the Pakistani
        military's offensive in North Waziristan that started in summer 2014.
        TTP spokesman Muhammad Omar Khorasani said that "we targeted the school
        because the Army targets our families. We want them to feel our pain.",
        "Our six fighters successfully entered the Army school and we are giving
        them instructions from outside," said Khorasani by phone.[according to
        whom?] During the massacre, Khorasani also said, "Our suicide bombers
        have entered the school, they have instructions not to harm the
        children, but to target the Army personnel. It's a revenge attack for
        the Army offensive in North Waziristan." Later though the Taliban
        claimed contrary by putting out a statement saying, "More than 50 sons
        of important army officers were killed after being identified." The
        attacks were mainly coordinated by TTP leaders operating in
        Afghanistan.Moustafa Seyan Sediqyar was later killed in a drone strike
        in Afghanistan on 9 July 2016.
      </p>

      <h2>Reactions</h2>
      <p>
        The attack sparked widespread reactions in Pakistan, receiving
        condemnations from public, government, political and religious entities,
        journalists, and other members of Pakistani society. Pakistani media
        reacted strongly to the event, with major newspapers, news channels and
        many commentators calling for renewed and strong action against
        militants, especially against the TTP. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
        condemned the attack, calling it a national tragedy and announced a
        three-day mourning period during which the national flag would fly at
        half mast. President Mamnoon Hussain and chief ministers of four
        provinces reacted strongly to the attack and condemned it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Major Pakistani political entities denounced and heavily condemned the
        attack on innocent children, calling for a strong reaction against the
        militants.Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Imran Khan called off the
        ongoing Azadi March protest in respect for the victims. Nobel Peace
        Prize winner Malala Yousafzai condemned the attack, saying in a
        statement: "I am heartbroken by this senseless and cold-blooded act of
        terror in Peshawar that is unfolding before us". Her father, Ziauddin
        Yousafzai said his "heart is bleeding" and his family is "traumatized"
        over the Peshawar school massacre.
      </p>
      <h2>Aftermath</h2>
      <p>
        Many international media organizations referred to the attack as
        Pakistan's "9/11".The popular opinion was one of anger against the TTP
        soon after the attacks. Pakistan's Government and its Armed Forces
        showed immediate reaction to the incident. According to the
        Iranian-American scholar, Vali Nasr, "the Taliban may be trying to
        slacken the resolve of the military by suggesting that there could be a
        tremendous human costs to the military offensive and create public
        pressure on the military to back off from this offensive, but it may
        actually ricochet on them." ISPR released the songs "Bara Dushman Bana
        Phirta Hai" and "Mujhe Dushman Ke Bachon Ko Parhana Hai", to pay tribute
        to the victims. In 2015, Pakistan renamed 107 schools after school
        children killed during the massacre in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region.
        Artists from around the world also expressed their concern and sadness.
        Pakistani artist and singer Shehzad Roy sang a new song for the victims
        of the Peshawar attack, which is now the official song on the National
        TV channel of Pakistan, PTV.
      </p>

      <h2>Reopening</h2>

      <p>
        The Army Public School Peshawar was reopened on 12 January 2015 under
        the guard of Pakistan's security forces.To uplift the morale and spirit
        of the students and victims of the school, the Chief of Army Staff,
        General Raheel Sharif, personally attended the morning assembly of the
        school and confirmed to them that no such incident will ever occur in
        Pakistan again as they will break the backbone of the Taliban.
      </p>
      <h2>Anniversaries and memorials</h2>
      <p>
        Yearly anniversary tributes are held in Peshawar, Pakistan with prayers,
        memorials and candlelight vigils. The main ceremony is held at the
        Peshawar Army Public School, with the parents of victims and Pakistani
        army officers in attendance, with portraits of victims displayed in the
        school and along the road into the city. From the first anniversary of
        the massacre, Pakistan Children's Day was moved to 16 December.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Army Public School attack on December 16, 2014, was a brutal and
        tragic act of terrorism carried out by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan
        (TTP), resulting in the deaths of 149 people, including 132 innocent
        schoolchildren. Targeting the children of military personnel, the
        attackers aimed to inflict maximum psychological and emotional damage.
        This horrific incident shook the entire nation and marked a turning
        point in Pakistan’s fight against terrorism. It led to the
        implementation of the National Action Plan, lifting of the death penalty
        moratorium, establishment of military courts, and intensified military
        operations like Zarb-e-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad. The APS attack is
        remembered as one of the darkest days in Pakistan's history, but also as
        a moment of national unity and resolve against extremism. The victims
        are commemorated annually, and their sacrifice continues to inspire
        efforts toward peace and security in the country.
