      <strong><h1>GHQ Attack (Codename: Operation Janbaz)</h1></strong>
      <p>
        The Pakistan Army General Headquarters attack (Codename: Operation
        Janbaz; Urdu: فوجی آپریشن جانباز), was a hostage-rescue mission carried
        by SSG Division on 10 October 2009, when 10 gunmen in military uniform
        opened fire on the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan.
        The attack killed nine soldiers, nine militants and two civilians and
        was a major escalation in Pakistan's domestic insurgency. One militant
        was wounded and captured by security forces. Soon after the attack, the
        militants infiltrated the security buildings where 22 civilian and
        military officials were held hostage by the militants. The Pakistan Army
        immediately launched a hostage rescue operation led by the SSG Division,
        Army Special Forces and the 13th Regular Regiment.
      </p>

      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>
        The Pakistan Army and Pakistani officials have speculated that the
        attack could have been in retaliation for a series of planned operations
        in South Waziristan.A report published in The News International on 5
        October, quoting Interior Department Punjab, had forewarned that
        militants wearing army uniforms would carry out an attack on GHQ. "If
        they fail to enter as per the first plan, then as an alternative they
        will drive the vehicle to the allegedly broken wall of the GHQ and
        jumped down into the compound using a ladder".The Daily Jang also
        reported on a possible threat.
      </p>

      <h1>Initial Attack</h1>
      <p>
        The attack began when 10 militants, wearing camouflaged army uniforms
        and armed with "sophisticated weapons", attacked a checkpoint at the
        army base.They arrived in a white van and attacked the compound with
        guns and hand grenades; at least three explosions were heard during the
        assault.During the attack, five militants and six soldiers were
        killed.The army dead included a brigadier and a lieutenant colonel.The
        attackers then took 42 hostages, said to include civilians and senior
        military personnel, to a location near the headquarters.<br />
        As the militants took over the security buildings, they took more than
        42 people at gunpoint. The majority of them were civilian officials and
        unarmed military personnel. Due to prohibition of bearing weapons inside
        the GHQ Headquarters, the militants easily took control of the
        buildings. The Pakistan Army quickly planned the hostage rescue
        operation. After limited hours of preparation, the hostage operation was
        launched under the code name of Operation Janbaz. This was followed by
        deploying Pakistan Army Special Forces, 13th Regular regiment, and the
        SSG Division. The operation was led by the SSG Division's teams, while
        the Army Special Forces also participated in the operation. The Special
        Forces and SSG Division's teams stormed the buildings, and a heavy gun
        battle ensued. Well-armed Pakistani forces, cleared the building in the
        first phase of the operation. The first 20 military personnel and
        civilian hostages were rescued by the Army Special Forces, and 3 injured
        militants were captured. After that, the remaining hostages were then
        rescued by the Pakistan army's Special Forces and the SSG Division.Among
        the hostages were 22 who were being guarded by a suicide bomber, who
        failed to blow himself up and was subsequently killed. During the
        attack, which took place at 0600 hrs., four militants, two commandos,
        and three hostages (two civilians and one soldier) were killed.Three
        commandos later died of their injuries. One militant was captured; he
        was named as Mohammed Aqeel (alias Dr. Usman), and was said to be the
        leader of the group and the mastermind of the 3 March attack on the Sri
        Lankan cricket team. Aqeel was arrested in a building separate from the
        other militants, and five hostages were rescued from him. He had also
        tried to blow himself up and was injured in the process.,<br />
        <br />Photographs of two of the attackers were released to the general
        public for identification.
      </p>

      <h1>Investigations</h1>
      <p>
        Police raided a house at Dhok Awan, Model Town Humak where the militants
        had stayed, and arrested the owner, Azam Qazi,as well as the property
        dealer who rented the house to the attackers. Several sets of Pakistani
        Army uniforms, maps of sensitive locations, fuses and detonators used in
        explosives, material used in making suicide jackets, and several
        identity cards were found at the safe house. Two pairs of trousers, two
        jeans, and over 10 pairs of Shalwar Kameez and slippers were also found.
        Evidence showed that at least 10 people were present at the house before
        the attack. The rent agreement was also found, which said the house was
        rented for Rs. 10,000 on 9 September. The attackers apparently stayed
        there for 20 to 25 days.Police also arrested another mastermind the
        attacks, Qari Ishtiaq, who is said to the commander of Punjabi
        Tehrik-i-Taliban. He was arrested from Bahawalpur on the information
        provided by the Hijratullah who has been jailed for 10 years due to his
        role in Lahore police academy attacks. 7 other militants were arrested
        from different parts of Punjab on his information him.
      </p>

      <h1>Responsibility</h1>
      <p>
        A first information report (FIR) was registered at Royal Artillery
        Bazaar (R.A Bazaar) Police Station against Mohammad Aqeel, alias Dr.
        Usman, for the attack. FIR no. 674 was registered under the
        Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). It alleged murder, attempted murder, and
        possession of explosives and illegal arms.<br />
        A Tehrik-e-Taliban (Amjad Farooqi Group) claimed responsibility for the
        attack in a phone call to an AFP reporter. The call was made by TTP
        spokesman Azam Tariq.<br /><br />

        " As long as Pakistan continues its operation against the Taliban, we
        will also keep continuing such attacks We claim responsibility for the
        attack on GHQ. It was carried out by our Punjab branch... We have the
        capability to strike at any place in Pakistan" <br /><br />
        Analysts have said the leader, Dr. Usman, is a member of the HUJI or the
        Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, acting in concert with the TTP.<br />
        According to ISPR, the attack was planned in South Waziristan, and 5 out
        of the 10 attackers belonged to Baitullah Meshud's group. According to
        Time, 5 of the 10 attackers were from Punjab.As such, the attack is
        believed to be one of the first major attacks attributed to the Punjabi
        Taliban, former state-supported militants now operating with the
        Taliban.Senior officials of the army were the prime target of the
        attacks. They were to be held hostage in order to secure the release of
        100 already detained militants.
      </p>

      <h1>Subsequent Airstrikes</h1>
      <p>
        Following the attacks, the Pakistan Air Force retaliated with two
        airstrikes on suspected militant targets in South Waziristan on Sunday
        evening, 11 October. According to Pakistani intelligence officials, five
        militants were killed.<br />
        On the night of 11 October, Pakistan Air Force fighter jets pounded
        various hideouts of militants in South Waziristan, killing 13 Taliban
        fighters.In the meantime, Pakistani UAVs and surveillance planes were
        intermittently flying over various areas of North and South Waziristan.
      </p>

      <h1>Media Blackout</h1>
      <p>
        Two news channels, Geo TV and Samaa, were taken off the air for an hour.
        A message from Pakistan's media regulatory body appeared on those
        channels announcing it was temporarily suspending transmission of
        "independent news TV channels" until further notice.
      </p>

      <h1>15 October Attacks</h1>
      <p>
        On 15 October, several more attacks were carried out against government
        buildings in areas across Pakistan. Four gunmen attacked the Federal
        Investigation Agency building in Lahore; seven police and attackers were
        killed in the assault. Also attacked were two police academies and a
        police station in Kohat.
