      <h2>Parliamentary System of Pakistan</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan follows a parliamentary form of government, which is modeled on
        the British Westminster system. The Constitution of Pakistan, adopted in
        1973, defines the country as a federal parliamentary republic. In this
        system, the President is the ceremonial head of state, while the Prime
        Minister holds the executive powers as the head of government. The
        Parliament of Pakistan is bicameral, consisting of two houses:

        <br />*National Assembly (Lower House)

        <br />*Senate (Upper House) The National Assembly members are directly
        elected by the people of Pakistan, while the Senate members are elected
        by the provincial assemblies. The Parliament makes laws, approves the
        budget, and oversees the functioning of the government. The Prime
        Minister is elected by the members of the National Assembly and must
        maintain their confidence to remain in power.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure of the Parliament</h2>
      <p>
        The Parliament of Pakistan is bicameral, consisting of two houses: the
        National Assembly (lower house) and the Senate (upper house). The
        National Assembly has 336 members, of which 266 are directly elected
        from constituencies across the country. An additional 60 seats are
        reserved for women, and 10 seats for religious minorities, which are
        allocated to political parties based on proportional representation. The
        National Assembly is responsible for passing laws, approving the federal
        budget, and overseeing the executive branch. The Senate, on the other
        hand, consists of 100 members who are elected by the members of the four
        Provincial Assemblies and the National Assembly. The Senate represents
        the provinces equally and ensures continuity in legislation. Senators
        serve for a term of six years, with elections held every three years to
        elect half of its members. This ensures a balance of power between the
        federation and provinces, and continuity in governance.
      </p>

      <h2>Role of the President</h2>
      <p>
        The President of Pakistan is the ceremonial head of state and symbolizes
        the unity of the Republic. The President is elected by an Electoral
        College, which includes members of both houses of Parliament and the
        four Provincial Assemblies. While the President holds some
        constitutional powers—such as the power to grant pardons, appoint judges
        and ambassadors, and address the Parliament—these are largely exercised
        on the advice of the Prime Minister. The President may also summon or
        dissolve the National Assembly under specific conditions, although such
        actions typically require the Prime Minister’s recommendation or a
        judicial review. The office of the President is designed to provide
        stability and serve as a neutral institution above political divisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP)</h2>
      <p>
        The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is a vital constitutional body
        responsible for ensuring the conduct of free, fair, transparent, and
        impartial elections in the country. Established under Article 218 of the
        Constitution, the ECP comprises the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC)
        and four members, one from each province. Its primary functions include
        preparing and updating electoral rolls, delimitation of constituencies,
        organizing and conducting general, local, and Senate elections,
        monitoring campaign financing and code of conduct, and resolving
        election disputes through tribunals. The ECP also introduces electoral
        reforms, such as the introduction of electronic voting machines (EVMs),
        biometric verification, and improved procedures for overseas voting. Its
        independence is crucial for the credibility of Pakistan’s democratic
        process.
      </p>

      <h2>Electoral System</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan’s electoral system is based on the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP)
        method for electing representatives to the National and Provincial
        Assemblies. Under this system, the candidate who secures the highest
        number of votes in a constituency wins the seat, regardless of whether
        they achieve a majority. The system is simple and easy to understand,
        though it often leads to disproportional representation, especially when
        multiple candidates split the vote. The Senate elections, however, are
        conducted using proportional representation through a single
        transferable vote, allowing smaller parties and regions fair
        representation. While general elections are held every five years,
        by-elections may also be held when a seat becomes vacant due to
        resignation, disqualification, or death of a member.
      </p>
      <h2>General Elections</h2>
      <p>
        General elections in Pakistan are held every five years to elect members
        of the National Assembly and the four Provincial Assemblies (Punjab,
        Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan). These elections are
        organized and supervised by the ECP, and conducted under strict security
        and legal procedures to ensure transparency and peace. Multiple
        political parties contest the elections, presenting their manifestos and
        campaigning across the country. The party or coalition that gains a
        simple majority in the National Assembly forms the federal government,
        and the President invites its leader to become the Prime Minister.
        Similarly, parties with a majority in Provincial Assemblies form
        provincial governments. The process includes nomination of candidates,
        scrutiny of documents, campaigning, polling, counting of votes, and
        declaration of results. Allegations of rigging, violence, or voter
        intimidation are common challenges, and the ECP and judiciary often play
        a role in addressing these issues.
      </p>

      <h2>Voting Rights</h2>
      <p>
        In Pakistan, all citizens aged 18 years or above are eligible to vote in
        general elections, provided they possess a valid Computerized National
        Identity Card (CNIC) and are registered as voters in the electoral rolls
        maintained by the ECP. The right to vote is universal, irrespective of
        gender, religion, or ethnicity. Voting is done through paper ballots at
        designated polling stations, where voters are expected to present their
        CNICs and cast votes in secret. Special arrangements are made for women,
        the elderly, and people with disabilities. While voting is not
        compulsory by law, it is considered a fundamental democratic duty. Over
        the years, efforts have been made to increase voter turnout and promote
        political awareness, including campaigns for female voter registration
        and youth participation.
      </p>
      <h2>Political Parties</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan has a multi-party political system, with a number of parties
        participating in elections at both national and provincial levels. Some
        of the most prominent parties include:

        <br />*Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N): A center-right party
        focusing on economic development, conservative values, and
        infrastructure projects.

        <br />*Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP): A center-left, progressive party
        with roots in socialism and strong support in Sindh province.

        <br />*Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI): A centrist to center-right party
        founded by Imran Khan, advocating for anti-corruption, justice, and
        governance reforms.

        <br />*Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM): A regional party with strong
        urban support in Sindh, especially Karachi and Hyderabad.

        <br />*Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) and other religious parties also play
        a role, particularly in conservative areas. These parties differ in
        ideology, regional strength, leadership, and support base. The electoral
        system encourages the formation of coalitions, particularly in the
        Senate and Provincial Assemblies, making alliances an essential part of
        Pakistan's democratic politics.
