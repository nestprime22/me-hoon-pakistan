      <p>
        <strong>Role of Military in Politics of Pakistan </strong> title can be
        described as the military has played a pivotal and often dominant role
        in the politics of Pakistan since its inception in 1947. Due to frequent
        political instability, weak democratic institutions, and security
        challenges, the military emerged as a powerful institution, often
        stepping in to fill governance vacuums. It has directly ruled the
        country for nearly half of its history through military coups in 1958,
        1977, and 1999. Even during civilian rule, the military has exerted
        significant influence behind the scenes, particularly in matters of
        foreign policy, national security, and internal governance. This
        pervasive role has often undermined the democratic process, weakened
        civilian institutions, and restricted the growth of a robust political
        culture. While the military justifies its involvement as necessary for
        national stability, critics argue that it has hindered Pakistan’s
        democratic development and accountability mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h2>Historical Background of Military Interventions</h2>
      <p>
        Since Pakistan’s early years, the military has emerged as a powerful
        institution due to a combination of regional security threats, weak
        political leadership, and institutional inefficiencies. The first
        military coup occurred in 1958 under General Ayub Khan, setting a
        precedent for future interventions. The military justified its takeovers
        by pointing to civilian incompetence and national emergencies. These
        repeated interventions established a pattern where democratic
        transitions were frequently interrupted, making it difficult for
        parliamentary democracy to take root.
      </p>
      <h2>Military’s Influence During Civilian Governments</h2>
      <p>
        Even during periods of elected civilian rule, the military has often
        wielded significant power behind the scenes. It has influenced foreign
        policy, especially regarding India, Afghanistan, and relations with the
        United States and China. Civilian governments have often had to seek the
        military’s approval or face resistance on key national security and
        foreign affairs issues. This "shadow control" has curtailed the autonomy
        of elected officials and created a parallel power structure that often
        limits genuine democratic governance.
      </p>

      <h2>Control Over Security and Strategic Policies</h2>
      <p>
        The military has maintained control over Pakistan’s strategic assets,
        including the nuclear program, counterterrorism operations, and
        defense-related policymaking. Through institutions like the
        Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, it has played a central role
        in both internal and external intelligence operations. This control has
        allowed the military to shape Pakistan's security narrative and project
        itself as the ultimate guarantor of national stability, often sidelining
        civilian authorities in the process.
      </p>

      <h2>Military and Judiciary Nexus</h2>
      <p>
        The judiciary in Pakistan has at times legitimized military takeovers
        through the "doctrine of necessity," which provided constitutional cover
        to martial law regimes. In return, military rulers have extended
        benefits to the judiciary, creating a complex relationship that has
        undermined the independence of the judicial system. This collaboration
        has contributed to the erosion of checks and balances and has made it
        difficult to hold the military accountable for its political
        interventions.
      </p>
      <h2>Impact on Democratic Development</h2>
      <p>
        The military’s continued involvement in politics has weakened democratic
        institutions such as parliament, political parties, and the media.
        Frequent disruptions in democratic rule have prevented the development
        of a stable and mature political culture. As a result, political parties
        have struggled to build long-term policies or gain public trust. The
        fear of military backlash often limits political expression and
        discourages bold reforms, hampering the country’s democratic evolution.
      </p>

      <h2>Recent Trends and Civil-Military Relations</h2>
      <p>
        In recent years, there has been growing public awareness and debate
        about the military's role in politics. While the military continues to
        influence major policy areas, especially under the guise of "national
        interest," there has also been pushback from civil society, the media,
        and some political leaders. However, tensions often arise when civilian
        governments attempt to assert authority over traditional military
        domains, revealing the ongoing struggle for balance in civil-military
        relations.
