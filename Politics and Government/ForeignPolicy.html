      <p>
        <strong>Foreign Policy of Pakistan </strong> title can be described as
        Pakistan’s foreign policy has its roots in the vision of Quaid-e-Azam
        Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who emphasized peace, sovereignty, and friendly
        relations with all nations, especially neighboring countries. The
        ideological foundation of the country, based on Islamic values and
        solidarity with the Muslim world, has also influenced its foreign
        relations. Since independence in 1947, Pakistan has strived to balance
        its Islamic identity with geopolitical and economic interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Islamic Republic of Pakistan emerged as an independent country
        through the partition of India in August 1947 and was admitted as a
        United Nations member state in September 1947. It is currently the
        second-largest country within the Muslim world in terms of population,
        and is also the only Muslim-majority country in possession of nuclear
        weapons. De facto, the country shares direct land borders with India,
        Iran, Afghanistan, and China.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pakistan's foreign policy seeks the 'promotion of Pakistan as a dynamic,
        progressive, moderate, and democratic Islamic country; developing
        friendly relations with all countries of the world, especially major
        powers and immediate neighbors; consolidating our commercial and
        economic cooperation with international community".
      </p>
      <p>
        Pakistan's foreign policy is meant to formalize and define its
        interactions with foreign nations and standardize interactions with
        organizations, corporations and individual citizens.Backed by the
        semi-agricultural and semi-industrialized economy, Pakistan is the 44th
        largest (nominal GDP, 2025) and 26th largest (purchasing) economic power
        and 7th largest military in the world in terms of active personnel, with
        a defense budget of US$10.2 billion (2024), 2.7% of its GDP (2024).
      </p>

      <h2>Muhammad Ali Jinnah's Vision</h2>
      <p>
        In 1947, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of the state of Pakistan, clearly
        described the principles and objectives of Pakistan's foreign policy in
        a broadcast message, which is featured prominently in a quotation on the
        homepage of Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website: "The
        foundation of our foreign policy is friendship with all nations across
        the globe."
        <br />
        <br />

        On 15 August 1947, outlining the foreign policy of Pakistan,
        Quaid-e-Azam observed:
        <br />
        <br />
        "Our objective should be peace within and peace without. We want to live
        peacefully and maintain cordial and friendly relations with our
        immediate neighbours and with (the) world at large. We have no
        aggressive designs against any one. We stand by the United Nations
        Charter and will gladly make our contribution to the peace and
        prosperity of the world."
      </p>

      <h2>Pakistan–China relations</h2>
      <p>
        China has played a significant role in the development, economy and
        security of Pakistan, with relationship beginning in 1951 when Pakistan
        was among the first countries to sever diplomatic ties with the Republic
        of China (on Taiwan Island) and recognizes the People's Republic of
        China (PRC) on Mainland China as the sole representative. Since then,
        both countries have placed considerable importance on the maintenance of
        an extremely close and supportive special relationship and the two
        countries have regularly exchanged high-level visits resulting in a
        variety of agreements. The PRC has provided economic, military, and
        technical assistance to Pakistan, and each country considers the other a
        close strategic ally.
      </p>
      <p>
        A cornerstone of the success of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
        is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). CPEC contains
        initiatives worth a total of $62 billion, such as infrastructure,
        energy, economic zones, and the development of the Gwadar port. A
        Chinese spokesperson said in 2022 that "the bond of friendship and
        mutual assistance between the Chinese and Pakistani people is stronger
        than gold, and the two countries' iron-clad friendship is deeply rooted
        in the people and boasts strong vitality.
      </p>

      <h2>Pakistan-Saudia relations</h2>
      <p>
        Saudi Arabia has also provided extensive religious and educational aid
        to Pakistan.[citation needed] Saudi Arabia remains a major destination
        for immigration amongst Pakistanis, the number of whom living in Saudi
        Arabia stands between 900,000 and 1 million.[citation needed] Saudi
        Arabia is the largest source of petroleum for Pakistan. It also supplies
        extensive financial aid to Pakistan and remittance from Pakistani
        migrants to Saudi Arabia is also a major source of foreign currency.
      </p>

      <h2>Pakistan-Turkey relations</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan has an embassy in Ankara and a Consulate General in Istanbul.
        Turkey has an embassy in Islamabad and Consulates General in Karachi and
        Lahore. Both countries are members of Asia Cooperation Dialogue,
        Economic Cooperation Organization, OIC and WTO. Trade volume between the
        two countries was US$856 million in 2019 (Pakistan's exports/imports:
        306/550 million USD). Yunus Emre Institute has a local headquarters in
        Karachi and Lahore.
      </p>
      <h2>Participation in International Organizations</h2>

      <p>
        Pakistan is an active and engaged member of various international
        organizations, using these platforms to advance its diplomatic,
        economic, and strategic interests. Within the United Nations (UN),
        Pakistan has made significant contributions, particularly through its
        longstanding role in UN peacekeeping missions, where it is recognized as
        one of the top troop-contributing countries. As a founding member of the
        Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Pakistan consistently
        advocates for the rights and unity of the Muslim world, raising its
        voice on issues such as the plight of Palestinians, the situation in
        Kashmir, and Islamophobia. In the South Asian Association for Regional
        Cooperation (SAARC), Pakistan promotes regional cooperation in areas
        like trade, health, and education, although progress has often been
        hindered by political tensions with India. Additionally, Pakistan's
        membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has opened new
        avenues for collaboration with Central Asian states and China,
        particularly in security, counterterrorism, and economic development.
        Through active participation in these organizations, Pakistan seeks to
        strengthen its global presence, build partnerships, and contribute to
        regional and international peace and stability.
      </p>

      <h2>Challenges to Foreign Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Despite its ongoing diplomatic efforts, Pakistan's foreign policy faces
        numerous complex challenges. One of the most persistent issues is the
        long-standing conflict and deep-rooted mistrust with India, particularly
        over the Kashmir dispute, which continues to hinder regional cooperation
        and peace initiatives. Additionally, regional instability, especially
        due to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and the presence of terrorism
        in border areas, poses serious security threats that directly impact
        foreign relations. Pakistan also struggles with economic dependency on
        foreign aid, loans, and support from international financial
        institutions, which limits its policy autonomy and negotiating power on
        the global stage. Another significant challenge is the negative global
        perception that associates Pakistan with extremism and militancy, often
        impacting its international image and partnerships. Furthermore,
        Pakistan must carefully navigate its relations with rival powers such as
        China and the United States, as well as Iran and Saudi Arabia,
        maintaining a delicate balance without alienating any side. These
        multifaceted challenges complicate the formulation and execution of a
        consistent and effective foreign policy, requiring strategic foresight,
        internal stability, and diplomatic skill.
      </p>
      <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan’s foreign policy is evolving in response to shifting regional
        dynamics and global developments. In the coming years, the country seeks
        to deepen its strategic partnerships with major powers such as China and
        Russia, leveraging these relationships for economic growth and
        geopolitical influence. Simultaneously, there is a strong emphasis on
        improving ties with neighboring countries, particularly India and
        Afghanistan, through dialogue and regional cooperation, despite the
        historical and ongoing challenges. Pakistan also aspires to play a more
        constructive and leading role within the Muslim world, championing
        causes that unite the Ummah and addressing global issues such as
        Islamophobia and humanitarian crises. Furthermore, promoting economic
        interests through enhanced trade, foreign investment, and participation
        in international initiatives remains a central pillar of its foreign
        policy strategy. Achieving these goals will require internal political
        and economic stability, skilled diplomacy, and the flexibility to adapt
        to an increasingly complex and multipolar global order.
