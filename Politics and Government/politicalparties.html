        <strong>Current Political Parties and Leaders of Pakistan </strong>
        title can be described as the Pakistan is a multi-party democracy. The
        country has many political parties and many times in the past the
        country has been ruled by a coalition government. The Parliament of
        Pakistan is bicameral, consisting of the National Assembly of Pakistan
        and the Senate.
      </p>

      <h1>Mainstream political parties</h1>
      <h2>Pakistan Muslim League (N)</h2>
      <p>
        The Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz is a Pakistani conservative political
        party that was founded in 1993 by senior politician, Nawaz Sharif. The
        party was founded as an offshoot of the Pakistan Muslim League, but is
        now its largest faction. It is currently still led by its founder Nawaz
        Sharif and is ideologically conservative as well as shares similarities
        with Nawaz's previous party, the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad. It saw rapid
        growth under Nawaz Sharif in the 1990s as it entered a two-party system
        with the Pakistan People's Party. It is also advocates for economic
        privatization, as Nawaz himself was a business owner. The party follows
        a free market capitalist and economically liberalist approach. It has
        developed a somewhat ideology around its leader Nawaz Sharif and has
        been led by members of the Sharif family. It has been right-wing for
        most of its existence but has shifted to a center-right position in
        recent years. It holds is base of power in Punjab, more specifically
        Lahore and has had 3 different prime ministers including Nawaz himself
        who served for the longest non-consecutive time (9 years). The prime
        ministers from the PML-N include Nawaz Sharif (3 terms), Shahid Khaqan
        Abbasi (1 term) and Nawaz's younger brother, Shehbaz Sharif (2 terms),
        who is serving right now.
      </p>

      <h2>Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)</h2>
      <p>
        The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf is a political party founded in 1996 by
        cricketer-turned-politician, Imran Khan. The party was founded on the
        premise of bringing change to Pakistan and to bring a new face to
        Pakistani politics, as when the party was founded the PPP and PML-N
        ruled Pakistan in a de-facto two party system. It advocates for
        welfarism and has promoted turning Pakistan into a modern welfare
        state.It has often seen populism around Imran Khan, a former cricket
        star. It launched a large-scale anti-corruption campaign across Pakistan
        in the 2000s and 2010s which led to its victory in the 2018 Pakistani
        general election. It holds its base of power in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but
        also holds significant popularity and influence across western Punjab,
        where Imran Khan is from. It has been widely seen as an
        anti-establishment party since 2022 as it clashed with Pakistan's
        military establishment. It was founded as a centrist party, though in
        2024, some sources indicated that the party had shifted center-right due
        to its pro-islamic unity teachings.Besides this it has advocated for
        rule of law and constitutionalism as part of its political alliance, the
        Tehreek Tahafuz Ayin. Despite being the largest political party in
        Pakistan in terms of membership, and in the top 10 largest parties
        worldwide, it has only had one prime minister, being Imran Khan himself
        who served for one term.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Pakistan People’s Party(PPP)</h2>
      <p>
        The Pakistan People's Party is a political party founded in 1967 by
        statesman, barrister and senior politician, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. It is
        by far the oldest out of the top ruling parties in Pakistan and was the
        first Pakistani political party to lay out a manifesto and ideology. It
        was founded on the premise of socialism and to struggle against the
        military rule of Field Marshal Ayub Khan (1958-1969). It has also been
        characterized as Pakistan's first democratic party and has been
        left-wing for most of its existence with its founder, Zulfikar Ali
        Bhutto being a left-wing populist, though in the 21st century it has
        shifted to a center-left position. Zulfikar ruled Pakistan from 1971
        until 1977, when he was overthrown and later hanged in 1979. The party
        has been widely seen as a dynastic political family party as it has seen
        its leadership pass down through the Bhutto family, which has seen a
        devoted cult of personality. After Zulfikar's death the party abandoned
        its socialist ideology and instead shifted to progressivism under
        Zulfikar's daughter, Benazir Bhutto. Benazir would be assassinated in
        2007 and since then the party has been controlled by her husband, Asif
        Ali Zardari as well as her son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. The party has
        been rivals with the PML-N for most of its existence but has joined
        hands with the PML-N against the PTI. Its main base of power is Sindh.
        The PPP is led by the Central Executive Committee and has seen 4
        different prime ministers including: Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1973-1977),
        Benazir Bhutto (1988-1990, 1993-1996), Yusuf Raza Gillani (2008-2012)
        and Raja Pervaiz Ashraf (2012-2013).
      </p>

      <h2>Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP)</h2>
      <p>
        Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) is a far-right religious party that has
        gained increasing popularity since its formation. It is currently led by
        Saad Hussain Rizvi, the son of the party's founder, Khadim Hussain
        Rizvi. TLP follows the Barelvi school of thought and is known for its
        hardline stance on blasphemy laws and defense of Islamic values. In the
        2024 elections, the party performed strongly, especially in Punjab,
        becoming the fourth-largest party in the National Assembly. TLP is known
        for organizing large-scale protests and street power demonstrations,
        often leading to national disruptions.
      </p>
      <h2>Awaam Pakistan (AP)</h2>
      <p>
        Awaam Pakistan (AP) is a newly formed centrist political party launched
        in July 2024 by former PML-N stalwarts Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Miftah
        Ismail. The party was officially registered in January 2025 with the aim
        of creating a modern, reform-oriented alternative to traditional
        dynastic politics. It focuses on constitutional democracy, institutional
        reforms, fiscal responsibility, and governance accountability. Although
        it is still in its early stages, Awaam Pakistan is expected to appeal to
        the urban educated class and technocrats dissatisfied with mainstream
        political options.
      </p>

      <h2>Jamaat-e-Islami (JI)</h2>
      <p>
        Jamaat-e-Islami is one of Pakistan’s oldest religious parties,
        advocating for the establishment of an Islamic system of governance
        based on the Quran and Sunnah. It is now led by Hafiz Naeem Ur Rehman,
        who was elected as the party’s Emir in April 2024. JI maintains
        influence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Karachi and focuses on education,
        justice, and Islamic values. The party often plays a significant role in
        alliance politics and is known for its organizational discipline and
        ideological clarity.
      </p>
      <h2>Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM)</h2>
      <p>
        Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM) is a Shiite political organization led
        by Raja Nasir Abbas Jafri. The party was formed in response to sectarian
        violence and aims to protect the rights of Shia Muslims in Pakistan. It
        also promotes unity among Sunni and Shia communities and calls for
        religious harmony. MWM has participated in electoral politics at both
        local and national levels and has alliances with various secular and
        religious parties.
      </p>
      <h2>National Democratic Movement (NDM)</h2>
      <p>
        The National Democratic Movement (NDM) is a progressive political party
        founded in 2021 by Mohsin Dawar, a former leader of the Pashtun Tahafuz
        Movement (PTM). The NDM focuses on minority rights, provincial autonomy,
        and opposition to military interference in civilian affairs. It
        represents a liberal, center-left ideology and has a strong presence
        among youth in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and tribal areas. The party continues
        to raise its voice for constitutional democracy and equal rights for all
        ethnic and religious groups.
      </p>

      <h2>Military's Role in Politics</h2>
      <p>
        While not a political party, the military establishment continues to
        have a profound influence on Pakistan’s political system. General Asim
        Munir, the current Chief of Army Staff, was promoted to Field Marshal in
        May 2025. His leadership during the recent conflict with India and his
        coordination with the civilian government have made him a popular and
        powerful figure. The military’s involvement in political
        decision-making, judicial matters, and even electoral processes is a
        persistent reality, often overshadowing civilian rule in critical areas
        of national policy.
