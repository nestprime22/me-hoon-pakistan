      <p>
        <strong>Judiciary and Law of Pakistan </strong> title can be described
        as the The judiciary of Pakistan is the national system of courts that
        maintains the law and order in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
        Pakistan uses a common law system, which was introduced during the
        colonial era, influenced by local medieval judicial systems based on
        religious and cultural practices. The Constitution of Pakistan lays down
        the fundamentals and working of the Pakistani judiciary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pakistan has two classes of courts: the superior (or higher) judiciary
        and the subordinate (or lower) judiciary. The superior judiciary is
        composed of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Federal Shariat Court and
        five High Courts, with the Supreme Court at the apex. There is a High
        Court for each of the four provinces as well as the federal capital. The
        Constitution of Pakistan entrusts the superior judiciary with the
        obligation to preserve, protect and defend the constitution.
      </p>
      <h1>Superior judiciary</h1>
      <h2>Supreme Court of Pakistan</h2>
      <p>
        The Supreme Court (KAS), established in 1956, is the apex court in
        Pakistan's judicial hierarchy, the final arbiter of legal and
        constitutional disputes. The court consists of a Chief Justice and
        sixteen other judges. There is also provision for appointment of acting
        judges as well as ad hoc judges in the court. It has a permanent seat in
        Islamabad as well as branch registries in Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta and
        Karachi. The Supreme Court Judges are supervised by the Supreme Judicial
        Council. After the appointment of Justice Qazi Faez Isa, there has come
        a significant change in the working of the apex court of the land. In an
        unprecedented act, the judicial proceedings are now televised in order
        to show the country how the superior court of the land works.
        Additionally, following the amendments by the Parliament, the suo moto
        powers of the Chief Justice have been curtailed as now in order for a
        suo moto case to be initiated, the 3 senior most judges must be in
        agreement that the matter is indeed of public importance and the court
        must act upon its powers and take up the case.
      </p>

      <h2>Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan</h2>
      <p>
        The Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan is a constitutional Islamic
        religious court, established in 1980 to scrutinise all Pakistani laws
        and determine if they conform to Islamic values "as laid down in the
        Quran and the Sunnah". If a law is found to be 'repugnant', the Court
        notifies the relevant government, specifying the reasons for its
        decision. The court also has appellate jurisdiction over penalties
        (hudud) arising out of Islamic law, although these decisions can be
        reviewed by the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court. The
        decisions of the court are binding on the high courts as well as the
        subordinate judiciary. The court appoints its own staff and frames its
        own rules of procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The court consists of eight Muslim judges, appointed by the President of
        Pakistan, on the advice of a judicial committee of the chief justices of
        the Supreme Court and the Federal Shariat Court. The committee chooses
        from amongst serving or retired judges of the Supreme Court or the high
        courts or from amongst persons possessing the qualifications of judges
        of a high court. Of the eight judges, three are required to be Islamic
        scholars/Ulema qualified in Islamic law. The judges serve terms of three
        years, subject to extension by the President. The current Chief Justice
        of the Federal Shariat Court is Justice Iqbal Hameed Ur Rehman.
      </p>
      <h2>High courts</h2>
      <p>
        There is a high court for the Islamabad Capital Territory and four
        provincial high courts. A high court is the principal court of its
        province.

        <br />*The Lahore High Court in Lahore, Punjab, with circuit benches at
        Bahawalpur, Multan and Rawalpindi. <br />*The Sindh High Court in
        Karachi, Sindh, with circuit benches at Hyderabad, Larkana, Mirpurkhas
        and Sukkur. <br />*The Peshawar High Court in Peshawar, Khyber
        Pakhtunkhwa, with circuit benches at Abbottabad, Bannu, Dera Ismail
        Khan, Mingora and Swat. <br />*The Balochistan High Court in Quetta,
        Baluchistan, with circuit benches in Sibi and Turbat. <br />*The
        Islamabad High Court in Islamabad, ICT
      </p>
      <h1>Subordinate judiciary</h1>
      <h2>District judiciary</h2>
      <p>
        District judiciary or district courts exist in every district of each
        province, and have civil and criminal jurisdiction ordinarily governed
        by Civil Procedure Code, 1908 for civil cases and by Code of Criminal
        Procedure in criminal cases. The administrative head of district
        judiciary is the 'district and sessions judge'. In each district
        headquarters, there are a number of courts of additional district and
        sessions judges having same judicial powers like the court of district
        and sessions judge, including trial for offences shown in schedule II of
        Code of Criminal Procedure as exclusively triable by the Court of
        Session i.e. Qatl e Amd (culpable homicide), rape, defamation dacoity
        etc. These courts have also jurisdiction to try cases under the Hudood
        Laws of Pakistan, certain offences under Control of Narcotic Substances
        Act etc. These courts also work as ex officio Justice of Peace to
        entertain complaints against police officials.
      </p>
      <p>
        All convictions awarded by judicial magistrates and convictions up to
        four years awarded by courts of assistant sessions judges or magistrates
        especially empowered under section 30 Cr.P.C. are appealable to a court
        of sessions judge which also transfer the criminal Appeals and criminal
        revisions to Additional Sessions Judges.
        <br />*The high court of each province has appellate jurisdiction over
        the lower courts. <br />* The Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction
        over disputes between and among provincial governments, and appellate
        jurisdiction over high court decisions. <br />
        Court usually starts early in the morning, with the hearing of
        pre-arrest bail applications, followed by post-arrest bail applications
        and civil appeals from the orders of the judicial magistrates' courts
        and civil judges. Decisions are usually announced later in the day, once
        the judge has had time to peruse the case files after the hearings. The
        rest of the day is allocated for the recording of the evidence in
        sessions cases such as in offences murder, rape and robbery etc. Cases
        are usually allotted by administrative orders of district and sessions
        judges. The court of the district and sessions judge usually hears
        administrative applications against lower courts orders.
      </p>

      <h2>Challenges Facing the Judiciary</h2>
      <p>
        Despite being constitutionally protected, the judiciary in Pakistan
        continues to face a range of serious challenges that hinder the delivery
        of effective and timely justice. One of the most pressing issues is the
        massive backlog of cases, which leads to prolonged delays in legal
        proceedings—often stretching over several years. This delay undermines
        public trust in the legal system and denies many citizens their right to
        speedy justice. Corruption and inefficiency, particularly at the lower
        levels of the judiciary, further erode confidence in the system. Many
        litigants report having to navigate a complex web of bureaucracy and
        unofficial payments just to move their cases forward. In addition, there
        is limited access to justice, especially for the poor and those living
        in remote or rural areas, where courts may be far away or
        under-resourced. Judges in Pakistan are often overburdened with heavy
        caseloads and lack the necessary administrative and technical support to
        efficiently manage proceedings. Furthermore, the inconsistent
        application of laws—often due to unclear legal interpretations or
        political influence—creates uncertainty and perceived unfairness in the
        legal process. While various judicial reform efforts have been
        initiated, including the digitization of records and the promotion of
        alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms, these have met with
        limited success. Structural issues such as outdated procedures, lack of
        accountability, and resistance to change continue to impede meaningful
        progress. Overall, systemic reform is urgently needed to restore public
        confidence and ensure justice is both accessible and equitable for all.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in Politics and Society</h2>
      <p>
        The judiciary has played a prominent role in Pakistan’s political
        landscape. It has been involved in disqualifying elected leaders,
        validating military coups (e.g., under the "doctrine of necessity"), and
        checking executive overreach. While some see it as a defender of
        constitutionalism, others criticize it for being politicized or
        selective in delivering justice.
