        <strong> Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad </strong>
        was a combined military operation by the Pakistani military in support
        of local law enforcement agencies to disarm and eliminate the terrorist
        sleeper cells across all states of Pakistan, started on 22 February
        2017.The operation aimed to eliminate the threat of terrorism, and
        consolidating the gains of Operation Zarb-e-Azb which was launched in
        2014 as a joint military offensive. It was further aimed at ensuring the
        security of Pakistan's bo Operation Radd-ul-Fasaadrders. The operation
        underwent active participation from the Pakistan Army, Pakistan Air
        Force, Pakistan Navy, Pakistan Police and other Warfare and Civil Armed
        Forces managed under the Government of Pakistan. More than 375,000
        intelligence-based operations had been carried out as of 2021. This
        operation has been mostly acknowledged after Operation Zarb e Azb.
        Pakistan had faced the worst brunt of terrorism due to its proximity to
        the all-time unstable Afghanistan and radicalization injected into the
        region since the Soviet-Afghan War that started in 1979. Offering land
        to host global Jihadism in the 80s changed the social fabric, resulting
        in a massive onslaught of terrorism that Pakistan had gone through since
        then. The pinnacle of infusion of venom by the multi-headed serpent of
        radicalization and terrorism was the era of 2006-2014. Pakistan Army
        fought terrorism gallantry and became the only army in the world that
        defeated terrorism without external help through several military
        operations, the biggest such operation was "Operation Zarb-e-Azb" which
        was started in June 2014. This operation successfully eliminated
        terrorist hideouts, nurseries, and breeding grounds in urban as well as
        far-flung areas. However, Pakistan could not be left without placing a
        mechanism that could ensure continuity and sustainability in
        anti-terrorism efforts to consolidate the gains achieved through
        Operation Zarb-e-Azb. The change of command was crucial and after the
        retirement of Raheel Sharif it was understood that the long-lasting
        success of Operation Zarb-e-Azb was depending upon a leadership that
        could manage the rehabilitation of internally displaced people in the
        former Federally Administrative Tribal Areas (FATA areas), Swat Valley
        and all other Afghan bordering areas.
