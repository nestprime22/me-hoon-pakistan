        India and Pakistan,Sparked by the killing of 25 Indian tourists by the
        militants.The Resistance Front (TRF) initially claimed responsibility
        for the attack.Armed skirmishes between India and Pakistan were reported
        along the Line of Control (LoC) beginning on 24 April. On 7 May 2025,
        India launched missile strikes in Pakistan, leading to a military
        conflict between the two countries. A ceasefire was announced on 10 May
        2025 following an agreement between India and Pakistan.The crisis
        emerged between the two countries after the Pahalgam terrorist attack,
        as India accused Pakistan of sponsoring the militants, though Pakistan
        denied its involvement. India initiated with the expulsion of Pakistani
        diplomats, recalling its diplomatic staff, suspending visa services, and
        suspending the Indus Waters Treaty.<br /><br />
        Pakistan suggested an international inquiry into the terrorist attack,
        which India rejected. Pakistan initially responded with trade
        restrictions, closure of airspace and border crossings, and suspension
        of the Shimla Agreement.Between 24 April and 6 May, Pakistan and India
        engaged in skirmishes including cross-border firing and intermittent
        artillery shelling.On 7 May 2025, India launched missile strikes on
        Pakistan, codenamed Operation Sindoor.<br />
        According to India, the missile strikes targeted the militant groups
        Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. According to Pakistan, the Indian
        strikes targeted civilian areas, including mosques, killing 31 Pakistani
        civilians. In return, Pakistan said they had downed a number of Indian
        jets and damaged Indian infrastructure. The military hostilities
        continued until a ceasefire was reached on 10 May 2025.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        On 22 April 2025, a terrorist Attack at Baisaran Valley near Pahalgam in
        the Anantnag district of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir killed at
        least 26 tourists and injured more than 20 others.According to
        eyewitness testimonies provided to Indian media outlets, assailants
        reportedly questioned potential victims about their religious identity
        before opening fire, specifically targeting non-Muslims.<br /><br />
        The attack became among the deadliest attacks against Indian civilians
        in the region since 2000. The Resistance Front (TRF), believed to be an
        offshoot of the Pakistan-based, UN-designated terrorist group
        Lashkar-e-Taiba,Initially claimed responsibility. They stated that the
        attack was in opposition to Indian government policy allowing Indian
        citizens to live and work in Kashmir, that resulted in non-local
        settlement in the region.Four days later, they retracted their claim.
      </p>

      <h2>Diplomatic Crisis</h2>
      <p>
        On the night of 23 April 2025, the Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri
        held a special press briefing after a meeting with the CCS. He announced
        India's decision to temporarily suspend the Indus Waters Treaty with
        Pakistan with immediate effect until Pakistan ceases its support for
        cross-border terrorism.He further announced the closure of the
        integrated check post at Attariâ€“Wagah Border, a travel ban for all
        Pakistani nationals to India under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme, and
        cancellation of all previously issued visas. Additionally, Pakistani
        military advisers at the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi were
        expelled, while their Indian counterparts in Islamabad were withdrawn,
        and the staff strength of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad was
        reduced from 55 to a minimum of 30. The posts of such military advisors
        were deemed abolished.<br /><br />Pakistan's Foreign Ministry expressed
        condolences to the families of the victims, and its defense minister
        Khawaja Asif dismissed the allegations of his country's involvement in
        the attack and regarded such events as revolutions.However, in an
        interview with Sky News, while responding to allegations of terrorism,
        Asif said that Pakistan had backed terrorist activities at the direction
        of United States, Britain and the West going back three decades.Pakistan
        responded to the suspension of the treaty by describing it as
        inappropriate and lacking seriousness.Pakistan also warned India of a
        comprehensive retaliation in response to the actions announced by the
        Indian government in the aftermath of the incident,Further stating that
        any action affecting water resources would be considered an act of war.
      </p>

      <h2>Initial Standoff</h2>
      <p>
        A joint cordon and search operation was initiated by the Indian Army,
        paramilitary forces, and Jammu and Kashmir Police. A temporary lockdown
        was imposed in Pahalgam, and Indian Army helicopters were deployed to
        track down the militants, who reportedly fled to the upper reaches of
        the Pir Panjal range.On 25 April, soldiers demolished the family
        residences of two individuals suspected of involvement in the Pahalgam
        attack.An Indian soldier was killed and two other soldiers wounded
        during a gunfight with insurgents in the Basantgarh region of
        Udhampur.Senior Lashkar-e-Taiba Commander Altaf Lalli was also killed in
        the gunfight.Both Pakistani and Indian air forces conducted intensive
        flights near the LoC.An Indian Border Security Force soldier belonging
        to the 182nd battalion of the BSF was captured by Pakistan Rangers after
        he accidentally entered the Pakistani side of the Ferozepur border.Also
        on 24 April, the Indian XV Corps reported that it had thwarted an
        infiltration attempt by insurgents near Uri and killed 2 insurgents.[58]
        Between 24 April and 5 May, Indian and Pakistani army engaged in
        skirmishes and exchanged small arms firing.Reportedly, Pakistan's army
        initiated small arms firing across various sectors along the LoC,which
        was described as "unprovoked" by Indian media.The Pakistani army stated
        it shot down two Indian military quadcopter drones along the LoC in the
        Satwal sector and in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district.On 28 April,
        Pakistani Defense Minister Asif stated that an attack from the Indian
        armed forces was "imminent".<br /><br />
        On 30 April, Pakistan claimed it has "credible intelligence" that India
        is going to launch military action within several hours.On the night of
        29 April, Pakistani forces opened fire on the international border along
        Kashmir.On 1 May, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah said that no terrorist
        involved in the attack would be spared by India.On 3 May, a soldier from
        the Pakistan Rangers was captured by BSF after crossing the border to
        India.On 5 May, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs announced an
        "effective civil defence in the event of a hostile attack" on 7 May
        across 7 states. Such drills were last conducted by India during 1971.
        As per reports, the drill includes operationalisation of Air Raid
        Warning Sirens, crash blackout measures, training of civilians on civil
        defence and evacuation plans.

        The suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 on 23 April 2025,
        local media in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, reported on 26 and 27 April that
        India had released water from the Uri Dam into the Jhelum River
        unannounced, resulting in flooding.Additional reports indicated a sharp
        decline in water levels of the Chenab River in Sialkot, Pakistan, with
        satellite imagery showing significant drying of the riverbed.On 4 May
        2025, India had closed the Baglihar Dam on the Chenab River and was
        planning a similar move at the Kishanganga Dam on the Neelum River.

      <h2>Missile Strikes And Escalation</h2>
      <p>
        ("Main article: 2025 Indiaâ€“Pakistan conflict") <br />
        On the night of 6/7 May,India launched "Operation Sindoor", striking
        what it described as "terrorist infrastructure" in Pakistan.The
        operation lasted 23 minutes and consisted of missile strikes by IAF
        jets. Rajnath Singh, Minister of Defence (India), said on 8 May that at
        least 100 militants had been killed in the strikes.<br />According to
        India, the missile strikes of Operation Sindoor targeted the camps and
        infrastructure of militant groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba,
        and no Pakistani military facilities were targeted. According to
        Pakistan, the Indian strikes targeted civilian areas, including mosques,
        killing 31 Pakistani civilians. Following these strikes, border
        skirmshes and drone strikes occurred between the two countries.<br />
        On 10 May, Pakistan launched an operation codenamed "Operation Bunyan
        al-Marsus" targeting several Indian military bases.In retaliation, India
        also continued Operation Sindoor, expanding its scope to target
        Pakistani military installations.This conflict marked the first drone
        battle between the two nuclear-armed nations.
      </p>
      <h2>Ceasefire</h2>

        a ceasefire was agreed, effective from 5:00 pm IST/04:30 pm PKT (11:30
        UTC) on 10 May, with talks set for 12 May.Following the deadline, both
        countries accused each other of violating the ceasefire agreement.
      </p>
      <h2>Aftermath</h2>

        Malhotra after accusing her of spying for Pakistan
      </p>
      <h2>Reactions</h2>
      <p>
        Further information: 2025 Pahalgam attack Â§ Reactions United Nations The
        United Nations urged both sides to have "maximum restraint" and to
        resolve the issues diplomatically.<br>

        <h3>Iran</h3>
        <br>
        On 25 April, the Islamic
        Republic of Iran proposed to mediate a solution aiming at de-escalation
        between Pakistan and India.<br><br>

        <h3>Russia</h3>
        <br> 
        Russia issued a travel advisory in April 2025, warning its citizens against traveling to Pakistan
        following the Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir. The advisory cited
        increased security risks in the region.<br><br>
        <h3>Others</h3> <br>
        The United Kingdom also issued a travel advisory warning in April 2025, mainly referring to
        the LoC. Members of the Indian diaspora protested outside the High
        Commission of Pakistan in London.<br><br>
        China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, urged for de-escalation between the two countries.Bangladesh
        and UAE supported peace talks.<br><br>
        <h3>United States</h3>
        <br>
        The U.S. State Department updated its travel advisory, issuing a Level 4 "Do Not
        Travel" warning for India's Jammu and Kashmir, citing high risks of
        terrorism and civil unrest.Additionally, the U.S. Embassy in New
        Delhi confirmed it is closely monitoring the situation and called for
        the perpetrators to be brought to justice, reaffirming its support for
        India's counterterrorism efforts.On 26 April 2025, President
        Donald Trump downplayed the diplomatic crisis, stating that the two
        nations "had that fight for 1,500 years", despite the fact that the
        Kashmir Crisis started in 1947. United States Secretary of
        State Marco Rubio stated that he is closely monitoring the situation
        after being advised by National Security Advisor of India Ajit Doval via
        phonecall after Operation Sindoor.<br>
         On May 10th, a few days after Vice President JD Vance stated the conflict was "none of our business",
        President Trump first announced the ceasefire on social media, claiming
        the US had an active role in mediating the agreement. While
        Pakistan acknowledged American involvement, Indian officials maintained
        the agreement had been reached directly between the two countries.<br>

        The Indian airstrikes targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan,
        included a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) camp in Bahawalpur. This camp was
        historically linked to the 2002 abduction and murder of Wall Street
        Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. The operation reportedly resulted in the
        death of Abdul Rauf Azhar, a senior JeM commander and brother of Masood
        Azhar, who was implicated in Pearl's beheading.<br><br>
        <h3>India</h3> 
        <br>
        The Government of India subsequently enacted a ban on several Pakistan-based
        YouTube channels for spreading provocative and communally sensitive
        content, as well as false narratives targeting the country, its Army,
        and security agencies, as well as a ban on Instagram accounts of several
        Pakistani celebrities.<br>
         As of 8 May 2025, the escalation has caused significant disruptions in air travel across the region. India
        has closed 27 airports in its northern and western regions until 10 May,
        resulting in the cancellation of over 430 flights. Major Indian
        airlines, including Air India, IndiGo, and SpiceJet, have suspended
        operations to and from affected areas. International carriers such as
        Lufthansa, KLM, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways have rerouted
        flights to avoid Pakistani airspace, leading to longer travel times and
        delays on routes between Europe and Asia. Pakistan has also suspended
        flights from key airports, including Karachi, Lahore, and Sialkot, until
        further notice. The situation remains fluid, with both countries'
        airspaces experiencing closures and reroutings, impacting global
        aviation networks.<br><br>

        <h3>Pakistan</h3> <br>

        In May 2025 a coalition of Pakistani actors including Adnan Siddiqui and Ghulam Mohiuddin called
        for peace talks, emphasising the urgent need for dialogue and
        understanding to foster harmony and resolve conflict.<br><br>

        <h3>Nepal</h3> <br>

        On 9 May 2025, a peace group held a mass demonstration to demand peace.
